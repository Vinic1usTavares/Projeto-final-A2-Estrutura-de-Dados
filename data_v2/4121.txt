selva ganesh producer of most of silk s films imran as film director vijayan mangal as a confidante of silk arya banerjee as shakeela an up and coming young actress who compares herself to silk vikas shrivastav as sudhir casting director mohit sinha as shivani as raadhika lavin as a fan of silk production development ekta kapoor launched film with director milan luthria soon after their collaboration once upon a time in became a hit she said that dirty picture would be india s answer to academy award nominated film boogie nights later in a press conference kapoor clarified that neither of balaji s forthcoming films ragini mms nor dirty picture were porn films as they had been made out to be kapoor has gone on record to add i would be surprised if i don t get unbelievable critical acclaim for dirty picture and a national award for my actress vidya balan film has one of most well written scripts i have come across and a lot of youngsters in my office have looked at it with great admiration she pointed out that purpose of film was neither to justify nor criticise smitha s life but for audience to live her life additionally all actors including balan and shah attended workshops for almost two months before filming began to familiarise themselves with body language of their characters when screenwriter rajat aroraa initially started working taking cues from producer kapoor scope of film was much smaller primarily looking back to soft pornography scene of 1980s as work progressed scope gradually widened to include controversial romances of smitha through a fictionalised biopic while researching for film director luthria and screenwriter aroraa found little material in magazines of that period as women like silk smitha were often ignored by film magazines except for gossip column mentions thus they derived many of details of her life from anecdotes and party gossips and then fictionalised them apart from depicting pomp of telugu tamil film industry screenplay takes up issues such as money management by actors their string of broken relationships and way they led lonely lives and met with tragic ends for inspiration instead of looking at south indian films of period team turned to work of mainstream bollywood directors like manmohan desai vijay anand raj kapoor feroz khan and g p sippy to put global soft porn industry in context team looked into boogie nights 1997 and people vs larry flynt 1996 final script became a fictionalised women oriented generalised perspective on 1980s film industry casting after initial talks with actresses kangana ranaut and bipasha basu fell through vidya balan was offered lead role when balan was narrated script and shown sketches of what she needed to wear for portrayal she felt uncomfortable luthria added we couldn t have found anyone better than vidya for this role it s a casting that very few would think is viable because it is going to be nothing like vidya has done before but i am confident she will push envelope as far as she can regarding criticism that balan s character might evoke luthria clarified i wanted vidya to know that what she s doing is not crass or crude but can be shown aesthetically in a sensual manner with a touch of class what her character does is not cheap as a reference point he also asked balan to study similar themed films such as burlesque and chicago balan also underwent salsa training to fine tune herself with smitha s languid body language next naseeruddin shah was cast as an ageing south indian superstar with hideous wigs dark glasses and painted on mustaches he performed a fast dance number in film a full 22 years after he last did it in song from 1989 regarding his character ekta kapoor stated this role requires him to play to gallery provoke claps laughs and whistles and i know he can pull it off because naseer is shah of all actors luthria added expect a man who unabashedly enjoys flesh of women tusshar kapoor and emraan hashmi were next cast in lead roles while it was known that tusshar kapoor would play role of a script writer and smitha s love interest nature of hashmi s role was unknown for a while casting received praise from trade pundits with taran adarsh commenting known for engaging in interesting and unconventional casting in all its previous releases balaji has again tackled unheard of by casting emraan hashmi and vidya balan two of most successful stars of today opposite each other in dirty picture perfect combination of mass and class promises to make this controversial film yet another winner from balaji stable filming filming was to begin on 21 may 2011 a week after release of kapoor s ragini mms but due to production delays it began a week later balan a religious person organised a puja on sets before principal photography began first leg of filming took place at mumbai s film city where an elaborate set re creating chennai then madras of 80s was set up second schedule was shot in ramoji film city in hyderabad song ishq sufiyana was shot at bidar fort in bidar karnataka filming was completed in september before venturing into post production ahead of december release director luthria wanted to depict a sense of discomfort between two lead characters balan and hashmi a meeting of two completely different worlds so he didn t allow them to interact and get comfortable with each other during film workshops ahead of shoot since he considered them unlikeliest pair to come together he brought them together right into shoot filming an important scene where they had to insult each other though he was initially anxious it all turned out well and he was surprised by resulting chemistry marketing thumb right upright balan promoting dirty picture in
