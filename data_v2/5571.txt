1st cavalry division was a horsed cavalry formation of royal yugoslav army that formed part of yugoslav 1st army group during german led axis invasion of kingdom of yugoslavia in april 1941 in peacetime division consisted of two cavalry brigades commanding a total of four cavalry regiments but its wartime organisation specified one cavalry brigade commanding two or three cavalry regiments along with divisional level combat and supporting units along with rest of yugoslav army 1st cavalry division began mobilising on 3 april 1941 and was still engaged in that process three days later when germans began an air campaign and a series of preliminary operations against yugoslav frontiers by end of following day division s cavalry brigade headquarters and all of division s cavalry regiments had been detached for duty with other formations of 1st army group divisional headquarters and divisional level units remained in vicinity of zagreb until 10 april when they were given orders to establish a defensive line southeast of zagreb along sava river with infantry and artillery support division had only begun to deploy for this task when german 14th panzer division captured zagreb divisional headquarters and all attached units were then disarmed by armed croat fifth column groups or surrendered to german troops thumb 350px map showing invasion of yugoslavia 1st cavalry

slovenes was created with merger of serbia montenegro and south slav inhabited areas of austria hungary on 1 december 1918 in immediate aftermath of world war i army of kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes was established to defend new state it was formed around nucleus of victorious royal serbian army as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by austria hungary many former austro hungarian officers and soldiers became members of new army from beginning much like other aspects of public life in new kingdom army was dominated by ethnic serbs who saw it as a means by which to secure serb political hegemony army s development was hampered by kingdom s poor economy and this continued during 1920s in 1929 king alexander changed name of country to kingdom of yugoslavia at which time army was renamed royal yugoslav army vkj army budget remained tight and as tensions rose across europe during 1930s it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries consequently at time world war ii broke out in september 1939 vkj had several serious weaknesses which included reliance on draught animals for transport and large size of its formations infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26 000 27 000 men as compared to contemporary british infantry divisions of half that strength these characteristics resulted in slow unwieldy formations and inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even very large yugoslav formations had low firepower generals better suited to trench warfare of world war i were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist fast moving combined arms approach used by germans in their invasions of poland and france weaknesses of vkj in strategy structure equipment mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within yugoslavia resulting from two decades of serb hegemony and attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by central government attempts to address disunity came too late to ensure that vkj was a cohesive force fifth column activity was also a serious concern not only from croatian nationalist ustase but also from country s slovene and ethnic german minorities formation and composition peacetime organisation according to regulations issued by vkj in 1935 1st cavalry division was headquartered in zagreb during peacetime and was under control of cavalry command in belgrade as was 2nd cavalry division which was located in southeastern yugoslavia at nis in peacetime 1st cavalry division comprised 1st cavalry brigade headquartered in cakovec near zagreb 2nd cavalry brigade headquartered in subotica in banat north of belgrade 2nd cavalry regiment based in virovitica on drava river in slavonia 3rd cavalry regiment based in subotica 6th cavalry regiment based in zagreb 8th cavalry regiment based in cakovec wartime organisation wartime organisation of royal yugoslav army was laid down by regulations issued in 1936 37 which introduced a requirement to raise a third cavalry division for war service strength of a cavalry division was 6 000 7 000 men theoretical war establishment of a fully mobilised yugoslav cavalry division was headquarters and headquarters company a cavalry brigade consisting of 2 or 3 cavalry regiments an artillery battalion of four batteries one of which was motorised and equipped with 47 mm anti tank guns a bicycle mounted infantry battalion with three rifle companies and one machine gun company a signals squadron a bridging squadron equipped with pontoons a chemical platoon a divisional cavalry battalion consisting of two cavalry squadrons a machine gun squadron an engineer squadron and a bicycle company logistics units each cavalry regiment was to consist of four cavalry squadrons a machine gun squadron and an engineer squadron shortly before war an abortive attempt was made to 1st cavalry division but this was stymied by a lack of motor transport and division largely remained a horsed formation throughout its existence 1st cavalry division was also never equipped with planned motorised anti tank battery and divisional artillery battalion was largely equipped with world war i vintage pieces two peacetime components of division 2nd cavalry brigade and 3rd cavalry regiment were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised so primary fighting formation of 1st cavalry division was 1st cavalry brigade commanding 2nd 6th and 8th cavalry regiments deployment plan in case of war yugoslav planners saw 1st cavalry division forming bulk of reserve for 1st army group 1st army group was responsible for defence of northwestern yugoslavia with 4th army defending eastern sector along hungarian border and 7th army along german and italian borders 1st cavalry division was to be held as 1st army group reserve around zagreb on left of 4th army boundary with 7th army ran from gornja radgona on mura through krapina and karlovac to otocac on right of 4th army was 2nd army of 2nd army group with boundary running from just east of slatina through pozega towards banja luka yugoslav defence plan saw both armies deployed in a cordon 4th army behind drava river between varazdin and slatina and 7th army along border region from adriatic in west to gornja radgona in east it was envisaged that reserve for 1st army group would be located in and around zagreb planners estimated that cavalry formations would take four to seven days to mobilise mobilisation after unrelenting pressure from adolf hitler yugoslavia signed tripartite pact on 25 march 1941 on 27 march a military coup d etat overthrew government that had signed pact and a new government was formed under royal yugoslav army air force commander armijski deneral dusan simovic a general mobilisation was not called by new government until 3 april 1941 out of fear of offending hitler and thus precipitating war however on same day as coup hitler issued fuhrer directive 25 which called for yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state and on 3 april fuhrer directive 26 was issued detailing plan of attack and command structure for invasion which was to commence on 6 april by time invasion commenced 1st cavalry division had only begun mobilisation according to yugoslav historian velimir terzic on 6 april mobilisation of division was proceeding slowly due to low number of conscripts that reported for duty and poor provision of animals and vehicles a large portion of strength of division had been earmarked to be detached to one of formations of 4th army detachment ormozki commander of 1st cavalry division was divizijski deneral dragoslav stefanovic while divisional headquarters and other divisional level units were mobilising in near zagreb headquarters of 1st cavalry brigade had been designated to command detachment ormozki and 6th and 8th cavalry regiments and divisional artillery battalion had also been allocated to that formation this reduced main fighting elements of division to a single cavalry regiment 2nd which was mobilising in virovitica rest of 1st army group reserve comprised an independent artillery battalion mobilising in zagreb and 110th infantry regiment which was moving to zagreb from celje a distance of to northwest by early morning of 6 april 1941 when invasion commenced 110th regiment had reached zidani most still some from zagreb operations stripped of most of its subordinate units 1st cavalry division remained in reserve near zagreb during first few days of fighting on 10 april due to critical situation on front of 4th army division was directed to take under its command 110th infantry regiment and independent artillery battalion and defend against crossings of stretch of river sava between jasenovac and zagreb while collecting stragglers and organising resistance these orders were quickly overtaken by rapid advance of 14th panzer division to zagreb when it broke out of its bridgehead across drava river at zakany on hungarian border by 19 30 on 10 april lead elements of 14th panzer division had reached outskirts of zagreb having covered nearly in a single day armed fifth column ustase groups and german troops disarmed division and its attached units before they could establish any coherent defence along sava on 15 april orders were received that a ceasefire had been agreed and that all vkj troops were to remain in place and not fire on german personnel after a delay in locating appropriate signatories for surrender document yugoslav supreme command unconditionally surrendered in belgrade effective at 12 00 on 18 april yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by axis powers with germany italy hungary bulgaria and albania all annexing parts of its territory notes footnotes
