been arrested in connection with incident and two international arrest warrants had been issued by spanish audiencia nacional suspected perpetrators are citizens of mexico us and south korea although latter two governments denied any connection with raid attack appears to have been violent perpetrators used knives and replica guns and a number of embassy staff were treated for injuries consistent with having been beaten another member of embassy staff injured herself by leaping from an upper window before alerting police spanish authorities investigations were kept secret for first month when they released their findings including names of suspected perpetrators they were criticised for possibly endangering named peoples lives spanish privately briefed media that they suspected but could not prove central intelligence agency cia involvement because attack was professional in its precision one former cia agent however said timing of attack and its high profile nature would have made it impossible for cia to have condoned it or taken part government of north korea described raid as an act of terrorism and demanded an international investigation embassy and its attache however did not report attack or any injuries sustained by staff to spanish police background free joseon also known as cheollima civil defense group alleged to have carried out attack has been described by washington post as a secretive dissident organization and a shadowy group trying to overthrow kim jong un whose government they claim to be an immoral and illegitimate regime free joseon is alleged to be composed primarily of north korean defectors but according to lawyer and north korea specialist joshua stanton there is a lack of evidence that any of people involved were even north koreans two days before attack group s website was recruiting field agents guards and field intelligence agents advertisements were tailored towards young people who had previously lived in china and were willing to devote to liberation of north according to website these roles required insight intelligence and physical strength sung yoon lee of tufts university said group is first known resistance movement against north korea which makes its activities very newsworthy greg executive director of committee for human rights in north korea said this is first time we see organized apparently militant resistance outside of north korea attack took place just before us president donald trump was due to meet kim jong un for further talks on dprk s proposed denuclearisation program a previous summit held in january 2019 in hanoi vietnam had failed and relations between north korea and us had deteriorated further dprk s embassy in madrid located at 43 dario quiet affluent northern suburb of consists of a two story luxurious villa with a swimming pool and is surrounded by pine trees compound is in middle of a patch of open land that has remained undeveloped because it assists natural drainage for area according to el pais since previous ambassador kim hyok chol was expelled in 2017 only one diplomat and two assistants with their immediate families living a relatively spartan existence were resident at time of attack neighbours however reported that a few days prior to attack a grand party that had attracted local attention had been held at embassy 22 february 2019 on friday 22 february 2019 adrian hong chang asked to see commercial attache yun suk so who was embassy s highest ranking diplomat in residence and with whom chang claimed to have previous acquaintance this had occurred two weeks earlier when hong chang using alias matthew chao managing partner of a fictional company baron stone capital had a brief meeting with yuk so regarding possibility of company investing in dprk once hong had been admitted to building remaining members of group burst in after him it is possible hong let them in himself as he waited on an interior patio for attache to appear ten masked individuals all but one of whom were below age of 30 were subsequently described as being asian in appearance and speaking korean they had probably congregated on open land outside embassy which would have attracted less attention than loitering near front entrance on a main road group carried what appeared to be replica firearms metal bars machetes and knives they also brought balaclavas a telescopic ladder and 33 rolls of double sided tape with them there were eight embassy staff members and guests a group of north korean architecture students all of who were swiftly tied up with ropes handcuffs and cable ties and hooded with bags gang interrogated and assaulted embassy staff attack has been described as especially violent two staff members later required medical attention mainly as a result of bruising from multiple heavy blows gang appear to have focussed primarily on attache whom they tried to persuade to defect and then assaulted when he refused they also questioned him intensively about hyok chol s affairs while he had been resident eventually they left him tied up in basement a korean female member of staff cho sun hi who lived in embassy with her husband hid in a second floor room and locked door around an hour into raid at about 5 pm she escaped from compound by jumping from window injuring herself sun hi screamed for help alerting neighbours who called police when police arrived they had difficulty in understanding sun hi who spoke no spanish they took her to a police station and tried to find an interpreter eventually they used a translation app on her phone police s difficulty in understanding sun hi was compounded by a head injury she had sustained woman told police a group of men have entered embassy and gagged staff she described raiders as commandos it was later established that in police chat groups sun hi s mental stability had been questioned police returned to embassy and attempted entry hong chang whom they assumed to be a member of staff because he was wearing a kim il sung kim jong il badge answered door and assured them there was nothing untoward occurring diplomatic law forbids police from entering premises without authorisation from head of mission which was not to be gained so they kept watch outside and set up a security perimeter police saw other men whom they identified as they waited to enter arrive meanwhile group ransacked building filming themselves as they did so they collected most of embassy s electronic equipment including computers mobile telephones hard drives and pen drives soon after police were called embassy gates suddenly opened and two or three luxury cars containing eight of intruders exited at speed police did not follow these cars were later established to be embassy vehicles with diplomatic numberplates they were found abandoned a few streets away hours later and were removed for forensic examination another car with hong chang in it apparently left from rear of building soon after it later transpired this was an uber taxi he had ordered in name of oswaldo trump group took all of stolen electronic equipment with them attack lasted for about five hours it began at 16 34 cet and had ended by 21 40 during raid assailants remained in full control of embassy and its occupants even after escape an incident is alleged to have taken place at door although early suggestions a death had occurred were unfounded when paramedics arrived they treated three injured investigation thumb logo of free joseon despite incident not being reported by embassy or its staff raid was investigated by spanish authorities although officially they only acknowledged something happened espionage was recognised early in investigation as a possible motive common criminality was excluded as a motive for raid which was described by investigators as having hallmarks of a cell in attack s perfectly coordinated military precision it was said investigators probably carried out by professionals who knew precisely what they were looking for before they attacked investigators said gang must have been responsible for lowering power and dimming street lights in road at front of embassy other security systems around building were also found to have been neutralised investigation which was described as highly secret was carried out by officers of provincial information brigade of spanish national police answering to court 5 of audiencia nacional high court which had authority to order arrest of those who had then been named guardia civil and nci carried out parallel investigations each focussing on different theories it was uncertain raiders were aware of embassy s business that day and may have been surprised by guests presence witnesses suggested gang members were south korean police visited south korean embassy to see if any of staff could be identified a few days later south korean ambassador chun hong jo wrote to el mundo denying his government s involvement in affair a spokeswoman for south korean embassy stated that we do not know anything we can not say anything else we heard about assault by press police did not come here kim hyok chol previous dprk ambassador to spain kim hyok chol had been expelled by spanish government in september 2017 in response to north korea s continued testing of nuclear missiles in defiance of international community although persona non grata in spain kim returned to dprk to become one of architects of kim jong un s diplomacy with us including failed vietnam summit analyst andrei lankov describes kim hyok chol as stephen s north korean counterpart little is known in west of kim hyok chol s personality or career it was noted that computers and telephones that were seized by attackers would be a treasure trove to intelligence services around world for information and communications they probably contained and would be eagerly sought after obtaining private information on kim hyok chol who has been described as a natural target for those interested in dprk s nuclear program and information on north korea s re armament program may have been purpose of attack tufts university professor sung yoon lee believed it likely seized materials could contain valuable information about any recent plans by dprk to evade sanctions against its government claims that were repeated on fox news by gordon g chang noting that kim hyok chol had been recalled from spain to lead north korea s negotiations lee suggested any information held on those computers including information on his activities in spain would have helped us and its allies to gain an edge in negotiations in hanoi for free group securing such top secret information would enhance their own status later events following their escape gang split into four groups and made their ways to portugal and then to us hong chang flew from lisbon airport to newark liberty day after attack on 14 march el mundo reported that at about midnight on 22 february spanish police had surrounded embassy compound and blocked all of approaches they entered building and performed a visual search in course of which they found a substantial cache of automatic weaponry consisting mainly of rifles and shotguns but also short arms paper s source speculated these were weapons intruders had used and had dumped before leaving on 26 march judge jose de la mata lifted injunction suppressing public knowledge of case because group had by then publicly identified themselves as members of a human rights movement seeking to liberate north korea court statement also stated that hong chang had acted without state assistance and group s statement later reiterated point lee lawyer representing joseon disputed legitimacy of judge s conclusions saying he had reached them without any evidence from accused themselves he also accused de la mata of irresponsibility in releasing names of individuals engaged in opposition to a brutal regime that routinely and summarily executes its enemies group also denied weapons or violence had been used in raid free joseon subsequently stated on their website they had received a request for help from comrades in a certain western country that involved a highly dangerous situation on 27 march 2019 they accepted responsibility for attack claimed responsibility for a graffiti attack on dprk embassy in kuala lumpur early following month and warned of a spectacular in near future saying kim jong un regime will continue to feel humiliated if it rejects order of freedom north korean government did not make a public comment until 37 days later when foreign ministry called assault a grave terrorist attack and suggested fbi involvement government demanded an investigation into an act of extortion by a small fry organisation that korean central news agency said should never be tolerated they said they would wait patiently and acknowledge spanish investigation in line with international law although former north korean diplomat thae yong ho said dprk government would be putting pressure on spain over incident they also said their embassy staff had been tortured and dprk summoned their ambassadors to moscow united states and united nations back to pyongyang according to thae yong ho this reflects importance regime places on its decryption software a further two members of gang were subsequently named sam ryu a us citizen and woo ran lee from south korea hong chang a resident of us but a citizen of mexico apparently telephoned fbi on 27 february opening day of us dprk summit to make a statement giving assailants view of events group subsequently announced they had shared information of enormous potential value under mutually agreed terms of confidentiality with fbi handing over everything they had taken from embassy including audiovisual material statement also denied anyone had been beaten or gagged fbi refused to deny or confirm existence of material or whether it was part of an investigation although they emphasised good working relationship bureau enjoys with its spanish counterpart us news sources reported that information received by fbi from an anonymous ex intelligence officer was pretty significant a video filmed claimed to have been filmed during raid was uploaded to group s website and to youtube it shows individuals smashing portraits of leading members of north korean regime despite group s claims of confidential agreements with fbi soon after they handed over stolen materials details of raid appeared in american press publicly linking group with raid free joseon said media coverage amounted to a betrayal of trust and a breach of confidentiality by fbi which they said had requested their intelligence and had been given it voluntarily group said speculative press reporting would endanger its members from north korean retaliation free joseon failed to gain immunity from prosecution for its members who had been involved in raid journalist laura bicker notes that hong chang is undoubtedly a wanted man by spanish high court and probably by pyongyang in a subsequent statement cheollima civil defense website stated parties seeking to out those in madrid have painted a target on backs of those seeking only to protect others they have chosen to side with pyongyang s criminal totalitarian rulers over their victims us authorities issued an arrest warrant for adrian hong on 9 april 2019 while christopher ahn one of perpetrators was arrested on 18 april that year reactions news outlets said neither embassy nor any of affected staff made an official report or complaint to spanish police although one woman who is thought to be one who had escaped said she had been assaulted analyst andrei lankov of korea risk group describes this lack of concern for well being of its staff and security of its embassy by north korean leadership as unusual lankov described forcible take over of diplomatic missions as extremely rare there was little reaction to raid even in south korea until mid march 2019 when free joseon s involvement was first alleged respective governments made no public comment on incident until spanish daily newspaper el pais reported that at least two of perpetrators had links to cia bbc news reported that because of us and north korea striving to improve relations after nearly 70 years of hostility such allegations could be explosive el said if cia s involvement was proven it would have been working with other western intelligence agencies cia is known to work closely with defector organisations according to financial times with caveat that such work does not in itself prove cia involvement in madrid episode other commentators such as bruce bennett of rand corporation said sponsoring an embassy invasion in light of number of us embassies would set a dangerous precedent spanish government sources acknowledged that even if their suspicions about cia involvement were accurate it would be difficult to prove allegations in court collusion of intelligence agencies in raid was also suggested by lankov he views involvement of north korean defectors as unlikely because very few of them would have requisite training and background operation demanded he also wrote that well over half of them are poorly educated middle aged women from provinces who speak little or no english few defectors with necessary skills and experienced are he says almost certainly known to intelligence services of their host countries and are probably under regular surveillance if they decided to create an organisation such as free joseon is claimed to be lankov said it would be infiltrated very quickly according to lankov such an organisation would be a front for intelligence agencies and that two most likely suspects for raid are cia and national intelligence service of south korea with former being a far more likely candidate at a news briefing robert palladino of us state department denied any involvement in raid by any part of government author and historian of cia jefferson morley compared attack to 1975 watergate break in writing embassy burglars sought information a la watergate unlike watergate they came by day citing unnamed spanish police investigators and officials from national intelligence center and general information office el mundo speculated information could also have emanated from within embassy to gang police said this would explain precision of attackers paper pointed to other occasions in which north korea had attacked its own diplomatic staff such as former north korean ambassador to rome who had disappeared in january 2018 sources whom washington post described as familiar with incident denied involvement of intelligence agencies however saying they would have been unwilling to involve themselves in such a high profile incident at a critical juncture in us dprk relations anonymous spanish government officials however reported in el pais stated that they were not convinced by cia s claim according to spanish news sources if cia was subsequently discovered to have been involved in attack this would damage us relations with dprk and spain and would be considered an unprovoked an unrequested incursion against spanish sovereignty and accepted norms of international diplomacy evidence of cia involvement would cause an uproar in north korea identities and nationalities of raiders were called particularly sensitive in light of delicate relations between us and north korea at time appearance of being involved with an invasion of extraterritorial immunity judge de la mata issued international arrest warrants for hong chang and ryu in march 2019 and stated that he would be formally request their extradition when they were served nbc news said it was unclear whether spanish authority s own investigation had revealed identities of those involved or whether us had passed them information according to dprk defector thae yong ho computer equipment taken by group could have included decryption software essential for secure communications between pyongyang and its embassies and missions known as transformation computer yong ho said to dprk leadership it was considered more important than human lives due to perception that its code was
