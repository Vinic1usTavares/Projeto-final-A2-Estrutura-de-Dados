bridgewater canal connects runcorn manchester and leigh in north west england it was commissioned by francis egerton 3rd duke of bridgewater to transport coal from his mines in worsley to manchester it was opened in 1761 from worsley to manchester and later extended from manchester to runcorn and then from worsley to leigh canal is connected to manchester ship canal via a lock at cornbrook to rochdale canal in manchester to trent and mersey canal at preston brook southeast of runcorn and to leeds and liverpool canal at leigh it once connected with river mersey at runcorn but has since been cut off by a slip road to silver jubilee bridge following construction of sankey brook navigation bridgewater has been argued to be first true canal of industrial revolution in england and it required construction of an aqueduct to cross river irwell one of first of its kind its success helped inspire a period of intense canal building in britain known as canal mania it later faced intense competition from liverpool and manchester railway and macclesfield canal navigable throughout its history it is one of few canals in britain not to have been nationalised and remains privately owned pleasure craft now use canal which forms part of cheshire ring network of canals design and construction francis egerton 3rd duke of bridgewater owned some of coal mines dug to supply north west england with fuel for steam engines instrumental in powering england s industrial revolution duke transported his coal along mersey and irwell navigation and also by packhorse but each method was inefficient and expensive river transport was subject to vagaries of river navigation vessels were affected by tide levels and shared use of water by industry and amount of coal packhorses could carry was limited by its relative weight duke s underground mines also suffered from persistent flooding caused by geology of middle coal measures where coal seam lies beneath a layer of permeable sandstone having visited canal du midi in france and watched construction of sankey canal in england duke s solution to these problems was to build an underground canal at worsley connected to a surface canal between worsley and salford in addition to easing overland transport difficulties and providing drainage for his mines an underground canal would provide a reliable source of water for surface canal and also eliminate need to lift coal to surface an expensive and difficult proposition canal boats would carry at a time pulled by only one horse more than ten times amount of cargo per horse that was possible with a cart duke and his estate manager john gilbert produced a plan of canal and in 1759 obtained an act of parliament enabling its construction james brindley was brought in for his technical expertise having previously installed a pumping system at nearby wet earth colliery and after a six day visit suggested varying route of proposed canal away from salford instead taking it across river irwell to stretford and thereon into manchester this route would make connecting to any future canals much easier and would also increase competition with mersey and irwell navigation company joseph 1998 hadfield s british canals sutton publishing brindley moved into worsley old hall and spent 46 days surveying proposed route which to cross irwell would require construction of an aqueduct at barton upon irwell at duke s behest in january 1760 brindley also travelled to london to give evidence before a parliamentary committee duke therefore gained a second act of parliament which superseded original brindley s planned route began at worsley and passed southeast through eccles before turning south to cross river irwell on barton aqueduct from there it continued southeast along edge of trafford park and then east into manchester although a connection with mersey and irwell navigation was included in new act at hulme locks in castlefield on land previously occupied by hulme hall this was not completed until 1838 terminus would be at castlefield basin where nearby river medlock was to help supply canal with water boats would unload their cargoes inside duke s purpose built warehouse there were no locks in brindley s design demonstrating his ability as a competent engineer barton aqueduct was built relatively quickly for time work commenced in september

replaced late in 19th century duke invested a large sum of money in scheme from worsley to manchester its construction cost 000 equivalent to ps in but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761 price of coal in manchester fell by about half this success helped inspire a period of intense canal building known as canal mania along with its stone aqueduct at barton upon irwell bridgewater canal was considered a major engineering achievement one commentator wrote that when finished canal will be most extraordinary thing in kingdom if not in europe boats in some places are to go underground and in other places over a navigable river without communicating with its waters in addition to duke s warehouse at manchester more buildings were built by brindley and extended to street now called deansgate warehouses were of timber frame design with load bearing hand made brick walls supported on cast iron posts duke s warehouse was badly damaged by fire in 1789 but was rebuilt thumb right bridgewater foundry at patricroft 1839 manchester to runcorn extension in september 1761 with his assistant hugh oldham brindley surveyed an extension from longford bridge to hempstones near halton cheshire he assisted in obtaining parliamentary approval for bridgewater canal extension act of act to enable most noble francis duke of bridgewater to make a navigable cut or canal from longford bridge in township of stretford in county palatine of lancaster to river mersey at a place called hempstones in township of halton in county of chester which allowed construction of an extension to canal from manchester to river mersey at runcorn despite objections from mersey and irwell navigation company royal assent was given on 24 march 1762 a junction waters meeting was created in trafford park at which new extension branched south through stretford sale altrincham and finally to runcorn in december 1761 brindley undertook a survey of route at runcorn his initial plan was to make terminus at hempstones east of runcorn gap but following a study of tides and depth of water there he decided instead to build terminus west of runcorn gap this change was designed to accommodate mersey flats although low fixed bridges required that traffic on canal be able to lower or their masts runcorn basin was almost above mersey so a flight of ten locks described as wonder of their time was built to connect two nine locks had a fall of with a fall at river lock of more than at low water it allowed vessels to enter and leave canal on any tide connection to mersey was made on 1 january 1773 river s tidal action tended to deposit silt around lower entrance to locks so to counteract this a channel equipped with gates at each end and known as duke s gut was cut through marshes upriver from locks at high tide gates were closed and with ebb of tide were opened to release water which scoured silt from entrance to locks cut created an island known as runcorn island crossed by castle bridge it was known as castle bridge because it made a connection with a rocky promontory which had once been site of a castle built by

was delayed by sir richard brooke of norton priory concerned that boatmen might poach his game and wildfowl brooke did not want canal to pass through his land act included several stipulations canal should not come within of his house towpath should be on south side of canal furthest away from brooke s house there should be no quays buildings hedges or fences to obstruct view no vessels were to be moored within of house other than during construction eventually though a compromise was reached this included construction of a link to trent and mersey canal at preston brook permitted by trent and mersey canal act of 1766 and building of canal s terminus to west of runcorn gap trent and mersey link gave duke access to midlands and forestalled weaver trustees from making their own junction with canal new extension also met with opposition from mersey and irwell navigation until duke purchased a controlling interest in company first part of new extension was opened in 1767 and completed in full by march 1776 but brindley did not live to see its completion it was continued by his brother in law hugh henshall total cost of canal from worsley to manchester and from longford bridge to mersey at runcorn was ps220 000 alongside mersey duke built runcorn dock several warehouses and bridgewater house a temporary home from which he could supervise operations at runcorn end two locks up from tideway was a small dry dock sale to stockport branch in 1766 duke gained a fourth act of parliament for a branch canal between sale moor and stockport which was to follow valley of mersey act was applied for to counter a proposed canal that would give towns of stockport and macclesfield access to mersey via river weaver work was not done act lapsed and this section of canal was never built over two decades later nearby manchester bolton bury canal had sought a connection to other waterways and it appears that duke had planned to limit activities of new company on 15 december 1792 duke purchased a portion of estate in salford which blocked mb bc s plans to build a riverside basin and wharfs there worsley to leigh extension in 1795 duke secured a fifth act which enabled him to extend canal a further from worsley via boothstown astley green and bedford to leigh new extension enabled supply to manchester of coal from leigh and surrounding districts on 21 june 1819 an act of parliament was enacted to create a link between this extension and wigan branch of leeds and liverpool canal access to canal brought about a rapid development in coal mining on manchester coalfield

navigation company m in journey down river by latter route took eight hours nine hours in up direction while journey on bridgewater canal took nine hours each way fares were similar but bridgewater route was said to be more picturesque boating men also used canal they lifted their small lightweight boats out of m in at runcorn and carried them a short distance up steep streets onto bridgewater canal barges on canal continued to be towed by horses until middle of 19th century when they were replaced by steam powered boats after a fatal epidemic spread through horse population dense smoke produced by steam barges and their harsh unnecessary whistling proved unpopular with some local residents who also began to suffer from a condition known as canal throat no doubt caused by foul emanations given off by its bridgewater canal s horribly filthy water canal carried commercial freight traffic until 1975 last regular cargo was grain from liverpool to manchester for it is now used mainly by pleasure craft and hosts two rowing clubs trafford rowing club and manchester university boat club bridgewater trustees duke of bridgewater died on 8 march 1803 by his will income from canal was to be paid to his nephew george leveson gower marquess of stafford later 1st duke of sutherland on his death it was to go to stafford s second son francis provided he changed his name to egerton and then to his heirs and successors management of company was placed in hands of three trustees these were sir archibald macdonald who was lord chief baron of exchequer edward venables vernon harcourt at time bishop of carlisle and later archbishop of york and as superintendent robert haldane bradshaw duke s agent bradshaw managed estate for which he received a salary of ps2 000 a year and use of duke s mansions at worsley and runcorn other two trustees had each married nieces of duke and were dummy trustees left thumb 400px value of trade carried on bridgewater canal 1806 71 during time canal was administered by bridgewater trustees it made a profit every year until his retirement in 1834 administration was carried out entirely by bradshaw it has been calculated that average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was of order of 13 per cent and in 1824 best year it was 23 per cent bradshaw found it difficult to delegate and complained of being over worked but he was also regarded as being a formidable bargainer in 1805 he was approached by proprietors of nearby manchester bolton bury canal to resolve a dispute with a salford landowner but his response was delayed in 1810 there was a general agreement with mersey and irwell navigation company m in to simultaneously raise freight charges however any cooperation between two companies was short lived and by 1812 mersey and irwell had reduced their charges further competition was to come from other carriers who used canal in 1824 traffic carried by private companies exceeded that carried by trustees for first time however in time more profit came from tonnage traffic that carried by private companies than from bridgewater s own carriage of freight bradshaw s administration saw increased deterioration of fabric of canal locks docks and warehouses undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in duke s will there were also problems caused by silting around entrance to mersey and by changing channels of river itself during 1820s there was increased dissatisfaction with canals they did not cope well with increasing volumes of cargo and they were perceived as monopolistic and preserve of landed gentry class there was increased interest in possibility of railway construction possible construction of a railway between liverpool and manchester was vigorously opposed by bradshaw who refused railway surveyors access to land owned by trustees when first bill was presented to parliament in 1825 trustees opposed and it was overthrown however later in year lord stafford possibly persuaded to do so by william huskisson invested ps100 000 one fifth of required capital in liverpool and manchester railway following this trustees withdrew their opposition to construction of railway they did not petition against second bill which was passed in 1826 at same time as he made his investment in railway lord stafford advanced ps40 000 for improvements to canal this was spent mainly on a second line of locks at runcorn which were completed in 1828 plus new warehouses at manchester and liverpool additional line of locks cost ps35 000 and was used for traffic heading to manchester while old line was used for traffic passing down to mersey in 1830 new railway opened and by end of year was carrying freight bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering rates of carriage on canal and by offering improved terms to private carriers by so doing he managed to maintain volume of traffic carried by canal both freight and passengers at a time when country was suffering a trade depression however bradshaw s tactics led to a sharp decline in profits at same time costs were rising partly due to use of steamboats on mersey further competition came with opening of macclesfield canal in 1831 which gave separate access to manchester from midlands in november 1831 bradshaw suffered a stroke as a result of which he lost use of his left arm and leg and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement matters came to a head in 1833 year in which canal made its lowest profit since death of duke on 19 july marquess of stafford now 1st duke of sutherland died and profits from canal passed to francis egerton on 25 september bradshaw s son captain james bradshaw who had been acting as a deputy superintendent to trustees and who had been expected to succeed his father as superintendent committed suicide agent for both francis egerton and his older brother who was now 2nd duke of sutherland was james loch events that followed were stage managed by loch he reported to francis egerton that bradshaw was no longer fit to be superintendent and then persuaded bradshaw to retire on his full salary it had been expected that he would appoint his other son william rigby bradshaw as his successor but loch persuaded him to appoint james sothern in position sothern had been principal agent of trust since december 1832 he took over position of superintendent on 3 february 1834 appointment of sothern was not a success charges were made against him of dishonesty and of nepotism he entered into disputes and disagreements with loch with francis egerton and with other two trustees sir archibald macdonald had died in 1826 by this time his place had been taken by 10th earl of devon to avoid a costly lawsuit at end of 1836 sothern agreed to retire on various conditions which included receipt of ps45 000 on 1 march 1837 he was succeeded as superintendent by james loch loch was extremely busy and did not have time to deal with detailed administration of trust he therefore looked for a deputy to take on these duties his first choice was richard smith who was mine agent to trustees of 1st earl of dudley however this was perceived as poaching and it led to such controversy that smith declined offer and recommended his son george samuel fereday smith for post fereday smith was appointed as deputy superintendent in march 1837 on a salary of ps600 a year half of salary which had been offered to his father loch immediately undertook a reorganisation of administration and efficiency of business restored agreement with old quay company to raise freight charges and improved facilities for passengers including introduction of swift boats by 1837 trustees employed around 3 000 people including those working in colliery and in worsley yard making it one of largest employers in country at time since death of duke amount of freight carried by canal had almost trebled in 1803 it carried of goods and in 1836 in 1843 a new dock francis dock was opened at runcorn late 1830s and early 1840s had seen increased competition between bridgewater canal on one hand and other canal companies and railways on other most dangerous of rivals was mersey and irwell navigation company who started to reduce their rates again in 1840 this led to a price war between two canal companies and liverpool and manchester railway who had previously cooperated on rates eventually in desperation bridgewater trustees bought mersey and irwell and took over its ownership on 1 january 1844 during same year competition with other canals was further reduced by agreements made with ellesmere and chester canal company and with anderton carrying company in 1844 canal made a profit of ps76 410 second highest during time it was administered by trustees having seen off competition from other canal companies next major threat was to come from railways this was period in mid 1840s known as railway mania railways competed with canals in three ways by building or threatening to build new lines which would be in direct competition with canals by amalgamation into giant companies such as midland and london and north western companies which gave them more political power and by taking over ownership of canal companies on 13 april 1844 times newspaper reported that canal was to be emptied of water and converted into a railway although nothing came of this scheme in 1845 in return for concessions trustees supported grand junction railway in its campaign to build a more direct line to liverpool which crossed mersey over a bridge at runcorn gap however bill was overthrown in house of lords competition from railways and other canals led to a decline in trading and profits between 1845 and 1848 but there was no disastrous collapse during this time trustees and their representatives were engaged in vigorous campaigns in parliament to protect their interests by october 1844 a bonding warehouse had been built in manchester and first cargo to arrive was announced in a letter to manchester guardian later printed in times however this venture was less successful than expected as is evidenced by a letter to observer later that year also printed in times between 1849 and 1851 competition between trustees and railway companies intensified agreements and alliances were made and broken their major opponents were london and north western railway and lancashire and yorkshire railway who reduced tariffs and took business away from canals for first time railways carried more trade between liverpool and towns of central lancashire than canals value of traffic carried by bridgewater canal in 1851 was lowest in time it was administered by trustees in 1851 earl of ellesmere hosted a visit to manchester by queen victoria and prince albert they stayed at worsley hall with a view of canal and were given a trip between patricroft railway station and worsley hall on state barges large crowds had gathered to cheer royal party which apparently frightened horses drawing barge so much that they fell into canal trustees spent much time between 1851 and 1855 in negotiations to ease competition especially that from london and north western railway most likely allies seemed to be other railway companies including shrewsbury and birmingham and shrewsbury and chester railway companies and great western railway of these most likely seemed to be great western railway who in their concern to expand northwards were willing to help trustees with carriage of their traffic to south however years of negotiations came to no agreement and in end trustees railway deal was done with london and north western railway who agreed to cooperate with onward passage of trustees traffic on 28 june 1855 james loch superintendent died and was succeeded by hon algernon fulke egerton lord ellesmere s third son he was then aged 29 and had been educated at harrow and christ church oxford he had been destined for a political life and had no experience of managing coal mines or canals since james loch had been appointed he had been mainly in control of management of trustees assisted by his son george loch during this time role of fereday smith had been diminished initially appointed as deputy superintendent his position was reduced to that of principal agent in 1845 with arrival of inexperienced algernon egerton fereday smith had a much greater say in management during previous four years lochs had been reluctant to invest in improvements to canal or runcorn dock despite increasing demand for passage of goods through dock and profits made during these years became stagnant fereday smith had been keen on expansion and now his opportunity came he first reduced top heavy administration of trust and then took on planning of expansion of business steamers owned by trustees had been neglected and were in a poor state these were repaired or sold george loch who had been opposed to using trustees investments for improvements to canals or docks died in 1857 between 1857 and 1872 trustees provided more capital for improvements from their own resources than at any previous time runcorn and weston canal was built in 1858 59 providing a connection between runcorn docks and weaver navigation a new half tide dock alfred dock was opened at runcorn in 1860 electric telegraph was installed in 1861 62 in 1862 2nd earl of ellesmere died and his son and heir 3rd earl was a minor aged 15 this gave algernon egerton even more power to invest profits of company in developments negotiations were made to increase sea borne trade both british and foreign through canal building started on a new dock at runcorn in 1867 work was carried out in mersey estuary around docks to improve access for vessels some of this was carried out in conjunction with london and north western railway who were building a bridge across runcorn gap to take their line from weaver junction to liverpool railway paid half cost of improvements amounting to about ps20 000 ps today improvements were made to trustees facilities at liverpool to mersey and irwell navigation and to bridgewater canal itself agreements were made with railway companies to cooperate on transit of goods and rates of carriage and trustees fortunes entered a calmer phase subsequent owners thumb right barton swing aqueduct built to replace original aqueduct during construction of manchester ship canal in 1872 bridgewater navigation company ltd was formed and on monday 9 september canal was purchased in names of sir edward william watkin and william philip price respectively chairmen of manchester sheffield and lincolnshire railway and midland railway for ps1 120 000 canal was sold again in 1885 when manchester ship canal company paid bridgewater navigation company ps1 710 000 for all their property construction of ship canal forced removal of barton aqueduct and construction of barton swing aqueduct as former was too low for vessels which would use new canal in 1907 manchester ship canal bridgewater canal act 1907 was passed permitting coal mining near canal between monton bridge and leigh in exchange for which mine owners were obliged to pay associated costs of keeping canal open and navigable in 1923 bridgewater estates ltd was formed to acquire ellesmere family estate in worsley in 1984 bridgewater estates ltd was purchased by a subsidiary of peel holdings in 1987 highams acquired a majority shareholding of manchester ship canal company subsequently shares held by highams were transferred to peel holdings
