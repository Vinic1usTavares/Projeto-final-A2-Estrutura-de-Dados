whiskery shark furgaleus macki is a species of houndshark in family triakidae and only member of its genus this common shark inhabits australian continental shelf from western australia to bass strait to a depth of it is demersal in habits and prefers rocky and vegetated habitats stout bodied and almost humpbacked in form whiskery shark can be distinguished from all other members of its family by presence of long nasal barbels its two moderately large dorsal fins are roughly equal in size it is brownish gray above and lighter below with a pattern of darker saddles and blotches in younger sharks this species reaches in length diet of whiskery shark consists almost entirely of octopuses it is viviparous females bear litters of four to 28 pups every other year from august to october after a gestation period of 7 9 months this harmless shark is used for its meat being one of species marketed as flake in australia it is mainly caught by a western australian commercial gillnet fishery its numbers declined significantly from overfishing in 1970s and early 1980s leading to introduction of new management measures in mid 1980s since then strict fishery management has kept whiskery shark population stable or increasing resulting in its listing as of least concern by international union for conservation of nature taxonomy and phylogeny australian ichthyologist gilbert percy whitley described whiskery shark as a new genus and species fur macki in a 1943 issue of scientific journal australian zoologist as name fur was already in use for genus fur of true flies in 1951 whitley replaced it with furgaleus type specimen is a long immature male caught off mordialloc in victoria australia other common names for whiskery shark include mack s whiskery shark reef shark shakey shark and sundowner sharks from western portion of this species range were once thought to be a separate species f ventralis until comparative studies by leonard compagno found that they were not significantly different from f macki based on morphology leonard compagno grouped furgaleus with hemitriakis iago and gogolia as tribe within subfamily of family triakidae a 2006 phylogenetic study by j andres lopez and colleagues based on four protein coding gene sequences affirmed that furgaleus and hemitriakis are sister taxa study was equivocal regarding position of iago and did not include gogolia description thumb distinctive traits of whiskery shark include its nasal barbels and humpbacked profile whiskery shark has a moderately stout build with an almost humpbacked appearance short snout is rounded or wedge shaped when viewed from above this species is only houndshark in which flaps of skin preceding nostrils are elongated into thin barbels horizontally oval eyes are placed high on head and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes protective third eyelids beneath eye is a prominent ridge and behind it is a tiny spiracle mouth forms a short wide arch and bears somewhat long furrows at corners tooth rows number 24 32 in upper and 36 42 in lower jaw each upper tooth has an angled knife like main cusp with smaller cusplets on trailing side while each lower tooth has a single upright cusp five pairs of gill slits are seen first dorsal fin is rather large and positioned closer to pectoral than pelvic fins though its origin lies posterior to pectoral fin rear tips second dorsal fin roughly equals first in size and is positioned slightly ahead of anal fin which is much smaller than either dorsal fin caudal fin has a short lower lobe and a deep ventral notch near tip of upper lobe adults are brownish gray above and lighter below young sharks are lighter in color and have darker saddles and blotches over body and fins which fade and may disappear with age this species grows up to long and in weight distribution and habitat endemic to australia whiskery shark inhabits temperate continental shelf waters from north west cape in western australia to wynyard in tasmania it is most common in southwestern portion of its range between kalbarri and albany and is rare off victoria and tasmania its range seems to encompass a single population this species is found close to bottom at depths to it favors rocky areas and kelp beds biology and ecology thumb left octopuses are predominant food source of whiskery shark whiskery shark is an active and highly specialized predator feeding almost exclusively on octopuses other cephalopods bony fishes small rock lobsters spoon worms and seagrass have also been found amongst its stomach contents a known parasite of this species is tapeworm like other houndsharks whiskery shark is viviparous developing embryos are sustained by yolk and probably also maternally produced histotroph males can mate every year while females have a biennial reproductive cycle mating takes place in august and september females store sperm until late january to early april of following year when ova are ready to be ovulated into uterus after a 7 to 9 month long gestation period litters of four to 28 average 19 pups are born between august and october litter size increases with size of female newborns measure long juvenile whiskery sharks are rarely caught by commercial fishers suggesting that nursery areas may be found in deeper water or other unfished habitats pups double to triple in size in first 15 17 months of life and continue to grow rapidly until they are 3 4 years old sexual maturity is attained at a length of for both sexes corresponding to around five years of age for males and seven years of age for females mature sharks exhibit negligible growth rates perhaps due to resources being diverted towards reproduction maximum lifespan is estimated to be 15 years human interactions harmless to humans whiskery shark is fished commercially for its meat which is sold fresh it is one of shark species marketed as flake along with dusky shark carcharhinus obscurus and gummy shark mustelus antarcticus it is targeted by a shark fishery operating off western australia currently managed as western australian joint authority southern demersal gillnet and demersal longline fishery fishery began in 1940s with a small number of demersal longline vessels though whiskery shark was not caught in substantial numbers until 1970s with introduction of monofilament gillnets hydraulic net haulers and additional vessels catches peaked in early 1980s when 400 600 tons were taken annually overfishing reduced population to 30 of pre exploitation levels by mid 1980s prompting western australian government to enact a management plan that stabilized population at 25 30 of pre exploitation levels in 1995 management advisory committee for western australian shark fishery recommended that whiskery shark stock be rebuilt to 40 of pre exploitation levels by 2010 11 season through a series of fishing effort reductions although this target was not met because effort reductions were not completed until 2000 01 preliminary catch per unit effort data indicate that population is increasing in 2004 05 this species made up 12 153 tons of fishery by weight whiskery shark is also a minor catch of southern shark fishery which does not threaten species overall since its population is stable and regularly monitored and fisheries that affect it are well managed international union for conservation of nature has assessed this species as least concern references external links fishes of australia furgaleus macki whiskery shark category marine fauna of
