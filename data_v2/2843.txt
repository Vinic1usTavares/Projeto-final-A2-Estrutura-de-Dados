west chosen after a much publicized battle with concert promoter clear channel entertainment cce who had handled her previous concert tours it marked first time concerts west outbid cce with reports claiming spears would earn between 13 and 15 million during tour spears s manager larry rudolph commented on situation saying clear channel is an incredible company and i m sure we ll be doing more business with them we went with concerts west because they re a strong touring company and because they have ancillary properties in that parent aeg owns arenas and some 7 000 movie theaters

performer she is turning her back to camera near end of stage she is wearing black pants and a black top with long sleeves showing her midriff in front of her a female dancer is climbing into a pole a crowd of people clapping screaming and taking pictures stands can be seen in audience name of tour was based on edgar allan poe s poem of same name tour was directed and choreographed by australian choreographer wade robson he explained concept of tour saying show is gonna be really really theatrical it s really complicated it s a massive show with a lot of new music it s just gonna be really different you re gonna learn a lot more about her as a person show is gonna be really about how she s becoming a woman how she s finding herself and her independence she knows what she wants to do she knows who she wants to be and that s what show s about stage was designed by production designer steven cohen and production manager rob brenner for hbo special this was first time spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end stage with a ramp and stairs at center as on her first 3 tours baby one more time tour you drive me crazy tour and oops i did it again tour cohen designed main stage with an oval shape so that spears could perform around stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles he said that rest of stage was created with three main components in mind a runway a b stage and a flying device over crowd last was developed as explained by cohen around this cleopatra s barge concept i got into my head while designing when movie cleopatra was playing in background it needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms plus it had to have a big enough performance area for her and dancers brenner continued i wanted to try to give kid in back of house same experience as one in first 10 rows runway uniting main stage and b stage was suggested by one of spears s managers johnny wright entire stage was built by michael tait from tait towers cohen said we took a more expanded role in preparing drawings for michael we wanted to retain essence of look of show both in its overall footprint and in execution of these various pieces he did a great job on executing fine details like hand railings and floor lights and mr 16 covers when you re doing something for tv all of those pieces are foreground pieces mirrors on platforms and floor painting made show look better on tv video screens showed both live shoots and special footage directed by robson cohen worked by danny o brien at bcc video to create double sided custom video led cubes that hanged above stage right there were three larger sized video screens above stage area gyrating wheel in which spears opened show was made by branam enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by tait towers 171 white light yag lasers were provided by spectra giant music box from which spears emerged in born to make you happy 1999 was designed by michael cotton confetti was shot from machines provided by pyrotek pyrotechnics were done by fountains whereas artificial snow was provided by little blizzard during encore performance of baby one more time 1998 there was a water screen in which it was poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute cohen said water screen is keystone of entire design because it impacts every system electrics staging dancing rob discovered company chameleon productions of orlando florida that makes screen and i immediately looked at what they had in stock which was a straight line and i knew we didn t want a straight line we wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to of course everyone thought i was crazy so i suggested a six sided shape everyone was concerned that gaps between sections might cause gaps in actual sheets of water but i kept saying that if you put them 40 to 50 up in air gravity will cause water to attach to itself so you end up getting a solid sheet lighting was designed by cohen and his partner in steve cohen productions joel young who served as tour s lighting director cohen continued saying all of our shows are heavily color based everything is rich in color there is a lot of layering that is not confusing so purity comes through young programmed show on a flying pig systems ii console which he ran while simultaneously calling 13 followspots for each show there were eight truss spots and five house spots four 2 5 kw instruments on back four robert on front truss four foh spots and one in back steve cohen productions also served as tour s lighting vendor and sublet gear they required from and fourth phase lsd provided its own lights apart from rest of lighting was a combination of and high end systems automated fixtures and conventional luminaries there were a total of 215 active lights a week before tour began spears said of show i come from broadway so i want it to be very theatrical whole process for me is magical hopefully it will be something people have never even imagined or envisioned in their head i was going through a run through yesterday and was thinking by time i m 30 there s not going to be anything left for me to do initial rehearsals for band started on september 9 2001 she joined them later after rehearsing choreography in los angeles setlist was composed mostly by songs from britney she explained her decision in a press conference saying i just want my fans to see me in a different light than they have ever seen me in before this music i am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who i am hopefully fans will come to show and be inspired and have a lot of fun several songs from her previous albums baby one more time and oops i did it again were remixed by robson to take them in a new direction flip them up a bit concert synopsis thumb encore performance of baby one more time with spears standing in water screen alt faraway image of a female performer she is walking

alicia keys song was often replaced with other new songs throughout tour some other changes were also made video screens did not have such a prominent role and backdrops of overprotected were taken out reception larry of national enquirer commented that concert packed more technical wizardry than harry potter but almost no actual singing he summarized his review saying if it wasn t quite a real concert it was a great show ann powers of new york times said show was dazzling and commented that performance did not suffer from music being its least important element adding this dream extravaganza perhaps unwittingly suggested that britney we know is herself a dream an artist whose genius is not for singing but for teasing out cravings and fears that haunt modern world ms spears now wants to awaken to an adult persona but she may find that netherworld of desire is her natural home jim farber of new york daily news compared it to tours of other teenage artists saying her latest 90 minute extravaganza had to be costliest most elaborate and to be honest least tacky to date he was also impressed with stage calling it largest proscenium i ve ever seen at a pop show camille lamb of daily collegian named show an elaborate highly homogenized display of capitalism at its finest she also said show fulfilled its expectations saying it brought a teenage fantasy to a tangible reality neva chonin of san francisco chronicle believed show was pure britney excess hugely entertaining and added that while it s all too easy to deride spears contrivances from a distance in person there s no denying her charisma or her archetypal appeal she s like a refugee from david lynch s mulholland drive a gleaming dream cipher waiting to be filled with an audience s fantasies and she works that role with flawless professionalism punctuating her choreographed moves with an amiable accessibility that drew fans into her airtight world even as it kept them at a safe distance

best pop music productions i ve ever witnessed lubbock and mexico cancellations show on june 14 2002 at united spirit arena in lubbock texas was cancelled due to a transformer blowing out during 2nd
