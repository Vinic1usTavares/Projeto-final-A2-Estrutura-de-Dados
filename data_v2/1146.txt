t personally against jackson himself just performance he stated that he admired jackson as a performer proclaiming that he can dance anybody who invents moonwalk is alright by me he even later claimed to be a michael jackson fan in 2010 jackson condemned cocker s behavior as disgusting and cowardly incident is referred to in book politics and popular culture by john street professor of politics at university of east anglia he says but to read popular culture as a straight forward or at least typical political text is to take a very narrow view of its meaning and hence of its political message s as we have noted text s meaning will depend on how it is heard and read michael jackson may have intended his earth song as an exercise in compassion others like jarvis cocker saw it quite differently one reason these alternative readings emerge is because of way performance of popular culture engages more than a literal text it employs gestures and symbols tones of voice looks and glances all of which might tell a different story 2010 grammy awards performance song along with a 3 d short film that was to be featured in jackson s series of comeback concerts this is it was performed as a
