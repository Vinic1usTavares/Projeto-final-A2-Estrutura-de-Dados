thumb mosaic of best resolution images of pluto from different angles pluto minor planet designation 134340 pluto is a dwarf planet in kuiper belt a ring of bodies beyond neptune it was first kuiper belt object to be discovered and is largest known plutoid or ice dwarf pluto was discovered by clyde tombaugh in 1930 as ninth planet from sun after 1992 its status as a planet was questioned following discovery of several objects of similar size in kuiper belt in 2005 eris a dwarf planet in scattered disc which is 27 more massive than pluto was discovered this led international astronomical union iau to define term planet formally in 2006 during their 26th general assembly that definition excluded pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet it is ninth largest and tenth most massive known object directly orbiting sun it is largest known trans neptunian object by volume but is less massive than eris like other kuiper belt objects pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small about one sixth mass of moon and one third its volume it has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or au 4 4 7 4 billion km from sun this means that pluto periodically comes closer to sun than neptune but a stable orbital resonance with neptune prevents them from colliding light from sun takes about 5 5 hours to reach pluto at its average distance 39 5 au pluto has five known moons charon largest with a diameter just over half that of pluto styx nix kerberos and hydra pluto and charon are sometimes considered a binary system because barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body new horizons spacecraft performed a flyby of pluto on july 14 2015 becoming first ever spacecraft to do so during its brief flyby new horizons made detailed measurements and observations of pluto and its moons in september 2016 astronomers announced that reddish brown cap of north pole of charon is composed of tholins organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for emergence of life and produced from methane nitrogen and other gases released from atmosphere of pluto and transferred about to orbiting moon history discovery left thumb alt same area of night sky with stars shown twice side by side one of bright points located with an arrow changes position between two images discovery photographs of pluto left thumb upright clyde tombaugh in kansas in 1840s urbain le verrier used newtonian mechanics to predict position of then undiscovered planet neptune after analyzing perturbations in orbit of uranus subsequent observations of neptune in late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that uranus s orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides neptune in 1906 percival lowell a wealthy bostonian who had founded lowell observatory in flagstaff arizona in 1894 started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet which he termed planet x by 1909 lowell and william h pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916 but to no avail unknown to lowell his surveys had captured two faint images of pluto on march 19 and april 7 1915 but they were not recognized for what they were there are fourteen other known precovery observations with earliest made by yerkes observatory on august 20 1909 percival s widow constance lowell entered into a ten year legal battle with lowell observatory over her husband s legacy and search for planet x did not resume until 1929 vesto melvin slipher observatory director gave job of locating planet x to 23 year old clyde tombaugh who had just arrived at observatory after slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings tombaugh s task was to systematically image night sky in pairs of photographs then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position using a blink comparator he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of plates to create illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs on february 18 1930 after nearly a year of searching tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on january 23 and 29 a lesser quality photograph taken on january 21 helped confirm movement after observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs news of discovery was telegraphed to harvard college observatory on march 13 1930 pluto has yet to complete a full orbit of sun since its discovery because one plutonian year is 247 68 years long name discovery made headlines around globe for example ninth planet discovered on edge of solar system first found in 84 years associated press new york times march 14 1930 p 1 lowell observatory which had right to name new object received more than 1 000 suggestions from all over world ranging from atlas to tombaugh urged slipher to suggest a name for new object quickly before someone else did constance lowell proposed zeus then percival and finally constance these suggestions were disregarded name pluto after god of underworld was proposed by venetia burney 1918 2009 an eleven year old schoolgirl in oxford england who was interested in classical mythology she suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather falconer madan a former librarian at university of oxford s bodleian library who passed name to astronomy professor herbert hall turner who cabled it to colleagues in united states each member of lowell observatory was allowed to vote on a short list of three potential names minerva which was already name for an asteroid cronus which had lost reputation through being proposed by unpopular astronomer thomas jefferson jackson see and pluto pluto received every vote name was announced on may 1 1930 upon announcement madan gave venetia ps5 equivalent to gbp or 450 usd in 2014 as a reward final choice of name was helped in part by fact that first two letters of pluto are initials of percival lowell pluto s astronomical symbol unicode u was then created as a monogram constructed from letters pl pluto s astrological symbol resembles that of neptune but has a circle in place of middle prong of trident name was soon embraced by wider culture in 1930 walt disney was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for mickey mouse a canine companion named pluto although disney animator ben could not confirm why name was given in 1941 glenn t seaborg named newly created element plutonium after pluto in keeping with tradition of naming elements after newly discovered planets following uranium which was named after uranus and neptunium which was named after neptune most languages use name pluto in various transliterations in japanese houei suggested translation and this was borrowed into chinese korean and vietnamese which instead uses sao diem vuong which was derived from chinese term yan wang as minh is a homophone for sino vietnamese words for dark ming and bright ming some indian languages use name pluto but others such as hindi use name of yama god of death in hindu and buddhist mythology polynesian languages also tend to use indigenous god of underworld as in maori whiro planet x disproved once pluto was found its faintness and lack of a resolvable disc cast doubt on idea that it was lowell s planet x estimates of pluto s mass were revised downward throughout 20th century mass estimates for pluto year mass estimate by 1915 7 earth

earth buie et al astronomers initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on neptune and uranus in 1931 pluto was calculated to be roughly mass of earth with further calculations in 1948 bringing mass down to roughly that of mars in 1976 dale cruikshank carl pilcher and david morrison of university of hawaii calculated pluto s albedo for first time finding that it matched that for methane ice this meant pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore could not be more than 1 percent mass of earth pluto s albedo is times that of earth in 1978 discovery of pluto s moon charon allowed measurement of pluto s mass for first time roughly 0 2 that of earth and far too small to account for discrepancies in orbit of uranus subsequent searches for an alternative planet x notably by robert sutton harrington failed in 1992 myles standish used data from voyager 2 s flyby of neptune in 1989 which had revised estimates of neptune s mass downward by 0 5 an amount comparable to mass of mars to recalculate its gravitational effect on uranus with new figures added in discrepancies and with them need for a planet x vanished today majority of scientists agree that planet x as lowell defined it does not exist lowell had made a prediction of planet x s orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to pluto s actual orbit and its position at that time ernest w brown concluded soon after pluto s discovery that this was a coincidence classification from 1992 onward many bodies were discovered orbiting in same volume as pluto showing that pluto is part of a population of objects called kuiper belt this made its official status as a planet controversial with many questioning whether pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting pluto from planetary models of solar system in february 2000 hayden planetarium in new york city displayed a solar system model of only eight planets which made headlines almost a year later as objects increasingly closer in size to pluto were discovered in region it was argued that pluto should be reclassified as one of kuiper belt objects just as ceres pallas juno and vesta lost their planet status after discovery of many other asteroids on july 29 2005 astronomers at caltech announced discovery of a new trans neptunian object eris which was substantially more massive than pluto and most massive object discovered in solar system since triton in 1846 its discoverers and press initially called it tenth planet although there was no official consensus at time on whether to call it a planet others in astronomical community considered discovery strongest argument for reclassifying pluto as a minor planet iau classification debate came to a head in august 2006 with an iau resolution that created an official definition for term planet according to this resolution there are three conditions for an object in solar system to be considered a planet object must be in orbit around sun object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity more specifically its own gravity should pull it into a shape defined by hydrostatic equilibrium it must have cleared neighborhood around its orbit pluto fails to meet third condition its mass is substantially less than combined mass of other objects in its orbit 0 07 times in contrast to earth which is 1 7 million times remaining mass in its orbit excluding moon iau further decided that bodies that like pluto meet criteria 1 and 2 but do not meet criterion 3 would be called dwarf planets in september 2006 iau included pluto and eris and its moon dysnomia in their minor planet catalogue giving them official minor planet designations 134340 pluto 136199 eris and 136199 eris i dysnomia had pluto been included upon its discovery in 1930 it would have likely been designated 1164 following 1163 saga which was discovered a month earlier there has been some resistance within astronomical community toward reclassification alan stern principal investigator with nasa s new horizons mission to pluto derided iau resolution stating that definition stinks for technical reasons stern contended that by terms of new definition earth mars jupiter and neptune all of which share their orbits with asteroids would be excluded he argued that all big spherical moons including moon should likewise be considered planets he also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it decision was not representative of entire astronomical community marc w buie then at lowell observatory petitioned against definition others have supported iau mike brown astronomer who discovered eris said through this whole crazy circus like procedure somehow right answer was stumbled on it s been a long time coming science is self correcting eventually even when strong emotions are involved public reception to iau decision was mixed many accepted reclassification but some sought to overturn decision with online petitions urging iau to consider reinstatement a resolution introduced by some members of california state assembly facetiously called iau decision a scientific heresy new mexico house of representatives passed a resolution in honor of tombaugh a longtime resident of that state that declared that pluto will always be considered a planet while in new mexican skies and that march 13 2007 was pluto planet day illinois senate passed a similar resolution in 2009 on basis that clyde tombaugh discoverer of pluto was born in illinois resolution asserted that pluto was unfairly downgraded to a dwarf planet by iau some members of public have also rejected change citing disagreement within scientific community on issue or for sentimental reasons maintaining that they have always known pluto as a planet and will continue to do so regardless of iau decision in 2006 in its 17th annual words of year vote american dialect society voted as word of year to pluto is to demote or devalue someone or something researchers on both sides of debate gathered in august 2008 at johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory for a conference that included back to back talks on current iau definition of a planet entitled great planet debate conference published a post conference press release indicating that scientists could not come to a consensus about definition of planet in june 2008 iau had announced in a press release that term plutoid would henceforth be used to refer to pluto and other objects that have an orbital semi major axis greater than that of neptune and enough mass to be of near spherical shape orbit thumb right animation of pluto orbit from 1900 to 2100 pluto s orbital period is currently about 248 years its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of planets which follow nearly circular orbits around sun close to a flat reference plane called ecliptic in contrast pluto s orbit is moderately inclined relative to ecliptic over 17deg and moderately eccentric elliptical this eccentricity means a small region of pluto s orbit lies closer to sun than neptune s pluto charon barycenter came to perihelion on september 5 1989 and was last closer to sun than neptune between february 7 1979 and february 11 1999 in long term pluto s orbit is chaotic computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years both forward and backward in time but after intervals longer than lyapunov time of 10 20 million years calculations become speculative pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of solar system hard to predict factors that will gradually change pluto s position in its orbit semi major axis of pluto s orbit varies between about 39 3 and 39 6 au with a period of about 19 951 years corresponding to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years semi major axis and period are presently getting longer relationship with neptune despite pluto s orbit appearing to cross that of neptune when viewed from directly above two objects orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely two orbits do not intersect when pluto is closest to sun and hence closest to neptune s orbit as viewed from above it is also farthest above neptune s path pluto s orbit passes about 8 au above that of neptune preventing a collision this alone is not enough to protect pluto perturbations from planets especially neptune could alter pluto s orbit such as its orbital precession over millions of years so that a collision could be possible however pluto is also protected by its 2 3 orbital resonance with neptune for every two orbits that pluto makes around sun neptune makes three each cycle lasts about 495 years this pattern is such that in each 495 year cycle first time pluto is near perihelion neptune is over 50deg behind pluto by pluto s second perihelion neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits and so will be nearly 130deg ahead of pluto pluto and neptune s minimum separation is over 17 au which is greater than pluto s minimum separation from uranus 11 au minimum separation between pluto and neptune actually occurs near time of pluto s aphelion 2 3 resonance between two bodies is highly stable and has been preserved over millions of years this prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another and so two bodies can never pass near each other even if pluto s orbit were not inclined two bodies could never collide long term stability of mean motion resonance is due to phase protection if pluto s period is slightly shorter than 3 2 of neptune its orbit relative to neptune will drift causing it to make closer approaches behind neptune s orbit strong gravitational pull between two causes angular momentum to be transferred to pluto at neptune s expense this moves pluto into a slightly larger orbit where it travels slightly more slowly according to kepler s third law after many such repetitions pluto is sufficiently slowed and neptune sufficiently sped up that pluto s orbit relative to neptune drifts in opposite direction until process is reversed whole process takes about 20 000 years to complete other factors numerical studies have shown that over millions of years general nature of alignment between orbits of pluto and neptune does not change there are several other resonances and interactions that enhance pluto s stability these arise principally from two additional mechanisms besides 2 3 mean motion resonance first pluto s argument of perihelion angle between point where it crosses ecliptic and point where it is closest to sun librates around 90deg this means that when pluto is closest to sun it is at its farthest above plane of solar system preventing encounters with neptune this is a consequence of kozai mechanism which relates eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body in this case neptune relative to neptune amplitude of libration is 38deg and so angular separation of pluto s perihelion to orbit of neptune is always greater than 52deg closest such angular separation occurs every 10 000 years second longitudes of ascending nodes of two bodies points where they cross ecliptic are in near resonance with above libration when two longitudes are same that is when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and sun pluto s perihelion lies exactly at 90deg and hence it comes closest to sun when it is highest above neptune s orbit this is known as 1 1 superresonance all jovian planets particularly jupiter play a role in creation of superresonance quasi satellite in 2012 it was hypothesized that arawn could be a quasi satellite of pluto a specific type of co orbital configuration according to hypothesis object would be a quasi satellite of pluto for about 350 000 years out of every two million year period measurements made by new horizons spacecraft in 2015 made it possible to calculate orbit of arawn more accurately these calculations confirm overall dynamics described in hypothesis however it is not agreed upon among astronomers whether arawn should be classified as a quasi satellite of pluto based on this motion since its orbit is primarily controlled by neptune with only occasional smaller perturbations caused by pluto rotation pluto s rotation period its day is equal to 6 39 earth days like uranus pluto rotates on its side in its orbital plane with an axial tilt of 120deg and so its seasonal variation is extreme at its solstices one fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness reason for this unusual orientation has been debated research from university of arizona has suggested that it may be due to way that a body s spin will always adjust to minimise energy this could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near equator and regions lacking mass tend towards poles this is called polar wander according to a paper released from university of arizona this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of dwarf planet these masses would cause body to reorient itself leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120deg buildup of nitrogen is due to pluto s vast distance from sun at equator temperatures can drop to causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on earth same effect seen on pluto would be observed on earth were antarctic ice sheet several times larger geology thumb high resolution mvic image of pluto in enhanced color to bring out differences in surface composition thumb left regions where water ice has been detected blue regions surface plains on pluto s surface are composed of more than 98 percent nitrogen ice with traces of methane and carbon monoxide nitrogen and carbon monoxide are most abundant on anti charon face of pluto around 180deg longitude where tombaugh regio s western lobe sputnik planitia is located whereas methane is most abundant near 300deg east mountains are made of water ice pluto s surface is quite varied with large differences in both brightness and color pluto is one of most contrastive bodies in solar system with as much contrast as saturn s moon iapetus color varies from charcoal black to dark orange and white pluto s color is more similar to that of io with slightly more orange and significantly less red than mars notable geographical features include tombaugh regio or heart a large bright area on side opposite charon cthulhu macula or whale a large dark area on trailing hemisphere and brass knuckles a series of equatorial dark areas on leading hemisphere sputnik planitia western lobe of heart is a 1 000 km wide basin of frozen nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices divided into polygonal cells which are interpreted as convection cells that carry floating blocks of water ice crust and sublimation pits towards their margins there are obvious signs of glacial flows both into and out of basin it has no craters that were visible to new horizons indicating that its surface is less than 10 million years old latest studies have shown that surface has an age of years new horizons science team summarized initial findings as pluto displays a surprisingly wide variety of geological landforms including those resulting from glaciological and surface atmosphere interactions as well as impact tectonic possible cryovolcanic and mass wasting processes in western parts of sputnik planitia there are fields of transverse dunes formed by winds blowing from center of sputnik planitia in direction of surrounding mountains dune wavelengths are in range of 0 4 1 km and they are likely consists of methane particles 200 300 mm in size internal structure thumb internal structure of pluto pluto s density is because decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat ices enough for rock to separate from them scientists expect that pluto s internal structure is differentiated with rocky material having settled into a dense core surrounded by a mantle of water ice diameter of core is hypothesized to be approximately 70 of pluto s diameter it is possible that such heating continues today creating a subsurface ocean of liquid water thick at core mantle boundary overlooked ocean worlds fill outer solar system john wenz scientific american october 4 2017 in september 2016 scientists at brown university simulated impact thought to have formed sputnik planitia and showed that it might have been result of liquid water upwelling from below after collision implying existence of a subsurface ocean at least 100 km deep pluto has no magnetic field mass and size

in 1978 enabled a determination of mass of pluto charon system by application of newton s formulation of kepler s third law observations of pluto in occultation with charon allowed scientists to establish pluto s diameter more accurately whereas invention of adaptive optics allowed them to determine its shape more accurately left thumb size comparisons earth moon and pluto with less than 0 2 lunar masses pluto is much less massive than terrestrial planets and also less massive than seven moons ganymede titan callisto io moon europa and triton mass is much less than thought before charon was discovered pluto is more than twice diameter and a dozen times mass of dwarf planet ceres largest object in asteroid belt it is less massive than dwarf planet eris a trans neptunian object discovered in 2005 though pluto has a larger diameter of 6 km compared to eris s approximate diameter of km determinations of pluto s size had been complicated by its atmosphere and hydrocarbon haze in march 2014 lellouch de bergh et al published findings regarding methane mixing ratios in pluto s atmosphere consistent with a plutonian diameter greater than 2360 km with a best guess of 2368 km on july 13 2015 images from nasa s new horizons mission long range reconnaissance imager lorri along with data from other instruments determined pluto s diameter to be which was later revised to be on july 24 and later to using radio occultation data from new horizons radio science experiment rex diameter was found to be atmosphere thumb upright 1 28 a near true color image taken by new horizons after its flyby numerous layers of blue haze float in pluto s atmosphere along and near limb mountains and their shadows are visible thumb upright 1 28 image of pluto in x rays by chandra x ray observatory blue spot x rays are probably created by interaction of gases surrounding pluto with solar wind although details of their origin are not clear pluto has a tenuous atmosphere consisting of nitrogen n2 methane ch4 and carbon monoxide co which are in equilibrium with their ices on pluto s surface according to measurements by new horizons surface pressure is about 1 pa 10 mbar roughly one million to 100 000 times less than earth s atmospheric pressure it was initially thought that as pluto moves away from sun its atmosphere should gradually freeze onto surface studies of new horizons data and ground based occultations show that pluto s atmospheric density increases and that it likely remains gaseous throughout pluto s orbit new horizons observations showed that atmospheric escape of nitrogen to be 10 000 times less than expected alan stern has contended that even a small increase in pluto s surface temperature can lead to exponential increases in pluto s atmospheric density from 18 hpa to as much as 280 hpa three times that of mars to a quarter that of earth at such densities nitrogen could flow across surface as liquid just like sweat cools body as it evaporates from skin sublimation of pluto s atmosphere cools its surface presence of atmospheric gases was traced up to 1670 kilometers high atmosphere does not have a sharp upper boundary presence of methane a powerful greenhouse gas in pluto s atmosphere creates a temperature inversion with average temperature of its atmosphere tens of degrees warmer than its surface though observations by new horizons have revealed pluto s upper atmosphere to be far colder than expected 70 k as opposed to about 100 k pluto s atmosphere is divided into roughly 20 regularly spaced haze layers up to 150 km high thought to be result of pressure waves created by airflow across pluto s mountains satellites pluto has five known natural satellites closest to pluto is charon first identified in 1978 by astronomer james christy charon is only moon of pluto in hydrostatic equilibrium charon s mass is sufficient to cause barycenter of pluto charon system to be outside pluto beyond charon there are four much smaller moons in order of distance from pluto they are styx nix kerberos and hydra nix and hydra were both discovered in 2005 kerberos was discovered in 2011 and styx was discovered in 2012 satellites orbits are circular eccentricity 0 006 and coplanar with pluto s equator inclination 1deg and therefore tilted approximately 120deg relative to pluto s orbit plutonian system is highly compact five known satellites orbit within inner 3 of region where prograde orbits would be stable orbital periods of all pluto s moons are linked in a system of orbital resonances and near resonances when precession is accounted for orbital periods of styx nix and hydra are in an exact 18 22 33 ratio there is a sequence of approximate ratios 3 4 5 6 between periods of styx nix kerberos and hydra with that of charon ratios become closer to being exact further out moons are alt thumb an oblique view of pluto charon system showing that pluto orbits a point outside itself two bodies are mutually tidally locked pluto charon system is one of few in solar system whose barycenter lies outside primary body patroclus system is a smaller example and sun jupiter system is only larger one similarity in size of charon and pluto has prompted some astronomers to call it a double dwarf planet system is also unusual among planetary systems in that each is tidally locked to other which means that pluto and charon always have same hemisphere facing each other from any position on either body other is always at same position in sky or always obscured this also means that rotation period of each is equal to time it takes entire system to rotate around its barycenter in 2007 observations by gemini observatory of patches of ammonia hydrates and water crystals on surface of charon suggested presence of active cryo geysers pluto s moons are hypothesized to have been formed by a collision between pluto and a similar sized body early in history of solar system collision released material that consolidated into moons around pluto origin thumb plot of known kuiper belt objects set against four giant planets pluto s origin and identity had long puzzled astronomers one early hypothesis was that pluto was an escaped moon of neptune knocked out of orbit by its largest current moon triton this idea was eventually rejected after dynamical studies showed it to be impossible because pluto never approaches neptune in its orbit pluto s true place in solar system began to reveal itself only in 1992 when astronomers began to find small icy objects beyond neptune that were similar to pluto not only in orbit but also in size and composition this trans neptunian population is thought to be source of many short period comets pluto is now known to be largest member of kuiper belt a stable belt of objects located between 30 and 50 au from sun as of 2011 surveys of kuiper belt to magnitude 21 were nearly complete and any remaining pluto sized objects are expected to be beyond 100 au from sun like other kuiper belt objects kbos pluto shares features with comets for example solar wind is gradually blowing pluto s surface into space it has been claimed that if pluto were placed as near to sun as earth it would develop a tail as comets do this claim has been disputed with argument that pluto s escape velocity is too high for this to happen nine reasons why pluto is a planet by philip metzger nonetheless it has also been claimed that pluto may have formed as a result of agglomeration of numerous comets and related kuiper belt objects though pluto is largest kuiper belt object discovered neptune s moon triton which is slightly larger than pluto is similar to it both geologically and atmospherically and is thought to be a captured kuiper belt object eris see above is about same size as pluto though more massive but is not strictly considered a member of kuiper belt population rather it is considered a member of a linked population called scattered disc a large number of kuiper belt objects like pluto are in a 2 3 orbital resonance with neptune kbos with this orbital resonance are called plutinos after pluto like other members of kuiper belt pluto is thought to be a residual planetesimal a component of original protoplanetary disc around sun that failed to fully coalesce into a full fledged planet most astronomers agree that pluto owes its current position to a sudden migration undergone by neptune early in solar system s formation as neptune migrated outward it approached objects in proto kuiper belt setting one in orbit around itself triton locking others into resonances and knocking others into chaotic orbits objects in scattered disc a dynamically unstable region overlapping kuiper belt are thought to have been placed in their current positions by interactions with neptune s migrating resonances a computer model created in 2004 by alessandro morbidelli of observatoire de la cote d azur in nice suggested that migration of neptune into kuiper belt may have been triggered by formation of a 1 2 resonance between jupiter and saturn which created a gravitational push that propelled both uranus and neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places ultimately doubling neptune s distance from sun resultant expulsion of objects from proto kuiper belt could also explain late heavy bombardment 600 million years after solar system s formation and origin of jupiter trojans it is possible that pluto had a near circular orbit about 33 au from sun before neptune s migration perturbed it into a resonant capture nice model requires that there were about a thousand pluto sized bodies in original planetesimal disk which included triton and eris observation and exploration pluto s distance from earth makes its in depth study and exploration difficult on july 14 2015 nasa s new horizons space probe flew through pluto system providing much information about it observation thumb computer generated rotating image of pluto based on observations by hubble space telescope in 2002 2003 pluto s visual apparent magnitude averages 15 1 brightening to 13 65 at perihelion to see it a telescope is required around 30 cm 12 in aperture being desirable it looks star like and without a visible disk even in large telescopes because its angular diameter is only 0 11 earliest maps of pluto made in late 1980s were brightness maps created from close observations of eclipses by its largest moon charon observations were made of change in total average brightness of pluto charon system during eclipses for example eclipsing a bright spot on pluto makes a bigger total brightness change than eclipsing a dark spot computer processing of many such observations can be used to create a brightness map this method can also track changes in brightness over time better maps were produced from images taken by hubble space telescope hst which offered higher resolution and showed considerably more detail resolving variations several hundred kilometers across including polar regions and large bright spots these maps were produced by complex computer processing which finds best fit projected maps for few pixels of hubble images these remained most detailed maps of pluto until flyby of new horizons in july 2015 because two cameras on hst used for these maps were no longer in service exploration thumb portions of pluto s surface mapped by new horizons annotated new horizons spacecraft which flew by pluto in july 2015 is first and so far only attempt to explore pluto directly launched in 2006 it captured its first distant images of pluto in late september 2006 during a test of long range reconnaissance imager images taken from a distance of approximately 4 2 billion kilometers confirmed spacecraft s ability to track distant targets critical for maneuvering toward pluto and other kuiper belt objects in early 2007 craft made use of a gravity assist from jupiter new horizons made its closest approach to pluto on july 14 2015 after a 3 462 day journey across solar system scientific observations of pluto began five months before closest approach and continued for at least a month after encounter observations were conducted using a remote sensing package that included imaging instruments and a radio science investigation tool as well as spectroscopic and other experiments scientific goals of new horizons were to characterize global geology and morphology of pluto and its moon charon map their surface composition and analyze pluto s neutral atmosphere and its escape rate on october 25 2016 at 05 48 pm et last bit of data of a total of 50 billion bits of data or 6 25 gigabytes was received from new horizons from its close encounter with pluto since new horizons flyby scientists have advocated for an orbiter mission that would return to pluto to fulfill new science objectives they include mapping surface at 30 feet per pixel observations of pluto s smaller satellites observations of how pluto changes as it rotates on its axis and topographic mapping of pluto s regions that are covered in long term darkness due to its axial tilt last objective could be accomplished using laser pulses to generate a complete topographic map of pluto new horizons principal investigator alan stern has advocated for a cassini style orbiter that would launch around 2030 100th anniversary of pluto s discovery and use charon s gravity to adjust its orbit as needed to fulfill science objectives after arriving at pluto system orbiter could then use charon s gravity to leave pluto system and study more kbos after all pluto science objectives are completed a conceptual study funded by nasa innovative advanced concepts niac program describes a fusion enabled pluto orbiter and lander based on
