menagerie near arsenal on edge of central park located at fifth avenue facing east 64th street spontaneously evolved from gifts of exotic pets and other animals informally given to park first animal a bear cub tied to a tree was left in central park in 1859 followed by a monkey next year these animals were popular with park s visitors even though there was no formal zoo at time soon people began donating other animals such as cranes a peacock and goldfish unsolicited donations came from a variety of people from prominent figures to young boys donations also included dead animals central park planning commission recorded all of these donations in its annual reports thumb left 1869 american zoological and botanical society which sought to create a zoo somewhere in new york city was created in early 1860 group began discussing possible sites for a zoo among them central park by 1862 were set aside for construction of a future zoological and botanical garden later central park zoo however since zoo s site was not yet formally designated animals were kept in central park mall popular animals included three bald eagles and a bald headed monkey in 1864 a formal zoo received charter confirmation from new york s assembly making it united states second publicly owned zoo after philadelphia zoo which was founded in 1859 by then park had over 400 animals more than 250 animals would be donated in 1864 1865 alone originally zoo was supposed to be located in manhattan square on west side of central park where american museum of natural history is now located though this location was never used as a zoo up to twelve sites would eventually be considered for zoo throughout last three decades of 19th century including north meadow of central park some animals were moved to arsenal in 1865 and larger animals grazed there during summers a deer park was established at current site of metropolitan museum of art three years later in 1870 when tammany hall political organization took control of central park commission it mandated that central park menagerie buy its own animals rather than accept donations and it moved animals to five structures behind arsenal same year benjamin waterhouse hawkins sculpted dinosaur figures for a proposed dinosaur exhibit at zoo but they were destroyed by tammany hall officials who did not appreciate these figures and pieces were rumored to be buried nearby menagerie became popular because of its free admission and proximity to working class lower manhattan by 1873 it saw 2 5 million annual visitors first permanent menagerie building was constructed behind arsenal in 1875 menagerie reached peak popularity in mid 1880s after a chimpanzee nicknamed mike crowley was imported from liberia observers such as former president ulysses s grant showed up at monkey house to see chimpanzee building past capacity however irish american groups took offense to chimpanzee s nickname saying that names given to animals in central park menagerie were stereotypically irish and thus derogatory to that ethnic group frederick law olmsted also disapproved of menagerie believing central park to be better suited for scenic vistas than for entertainment though he admitted that zoo was most popular part of park by 1890s wealthy residents of nearby neighborhoods were clamoring for zoo to be relocated somewhere else such as north meadow however these efforts met resistance as central park menagerie was popular among general public and among politicians that represented them this subsequently led to creation of bronx zoo a much larger privately operated zoo in bronx in 1897 though wealthy residents hoped that people would travel to bronx zoo for its superior facilities central park zoo continued to be popular even after bronx zoo opened in 1899 central park menagerie attracted over three million people annually by 1902 more than museum of natural history and metropolitan museum combined despite only receiving one fifth as much money as either of museums through early 20th century quality of menagerie declined through neglect from city government which administered zoo zoo accepted creatures of all kinds even those with health problems but offered insufficient veterinary care in 1919 some of structures at central park menagerie were modified to accommodate addition of new animals subsequently in 1932 a new concrete structure was built for zoo s wolves because previous steel enclosure was deemed insufficient to contain wolves by then zoo was extremely rundown and its 22 cages were regarded as flimsy and rat ridden wooden sheds posed a fire hazard and enclosures were so ineffective that zookeepers guarded lion house to prevent lions from escaping new zoo thumb right upright 1 sea lion pool as seen looking south toward midtown assuming office in january 1934 new york city mayor fiorello la guardia tapped robert moses to head a newly unified parks department moses soon prepared extensive plans to reconstruct city s parks renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools zoos playgrounds and parks moses acquired substantial civil works administration and later works progress administration funding and soon embarked upon an eight year citywide construction program relieving some of high unemployment in new york city in this depression year plans for new central park zoo were prepared by aymar embury ii within a 16 day span in february 1934 and were announced following month embury s plans called for nine terracotta and brick structures to replace structures in menagerie these structures included seven new animal enclosures as well as a comfort station and a garage a sea lion pool designed by charles schmieder was to be located in center of new zoo surrounded by zoo enclosures on three sides new structures were designed in such a way that they could be maintained easily buildings to cost 411 000 were designed in conjunction with new enclosures at prospect park zoo reconstruction of zoo was initially criticized by individuals who thought that money spent on building a zoo would be better utilized on construction of new schools around city during reconstruction previous structures were entirely demolished while construction was ongoing animals were temporarily moved to other zoos rebuilt zoo opened on december 2 1934 at a ceremony where former governor al smith was given honorary title of night superintendent by april 1936 renovated zoo had seen six million visitors since its reopening to prevent recurrence of rat infestations moses

statue dubbed whaley which acted as entrance to small zoo a noah s ark feature and a medieval castle feature animals were housed in small storybook style structures bordering an irregular pond decline by 1967 wooden railings around main zoo s enclosures were rotting and nyc parks commissioner august heckscher ii had authorized repairs to these railings same year zoo cafeteria was renovated after a new concessionaire took control of cafe in late 1960s and early 1970s new york city subway s 63rd street lines present day were being built directly underneath zoo a graffiti wall was erected along line s length through central park tunnel provided a subterranean gathering place for very early subway artists who hung around together in central park and was named zoo york by ali founder of soul artists graffiti crew name came about because it was in a zoo in new york hence zoo york construction of subway line itself was controversial because it called for of cut and cover tunneling which required digging an open trench through central park and then covering it over one of concerns was that central park zoo and a bird sanctuary outside zoo were located very close to boundary of trench eventually new york city transit authority which operated new york city subway agreed to reduce disruption by halving length of cut a nature kiosk at central park zoo was added in 1972 and a 500 000 renovation for lion house was proposed following year by then central park zoo was quite dilapidated in november 1974 protesters gathered outside zoo to protest conditions there nyc parks commissioner

dedicated curatorial staff and all had only a skeletal staff society proposed sending larger animals to different zoos with more humane conditions and animal rights groups sued city in an effort to close two zoos and move animals to larger bronx zoo a 1976 report by world federation for protection of animals found that all three zoos were operating in shameful conditions and that animals at central park and prospect park zoos were living in poorly maintained facilities renovations alt left thumb children s zoo after fifteen years of sporadic conversations administration of mayor ed koch

construction society started charging admission for zoo patrons for first time in zoo s history with reopening of central park zoo society aimed to designate each of its three small zoos with a specific purpose central park zoo would be focused toward conservation prospect park zoo would be primarily a children s zoo and queens zoo would become a zoo with north american animals by early 1990s some of structures at children s zoo had collapsed and there were reports that animals were being neglected under threat of closure by federal regulators city closed zoo in 1991 though wcs had a plan to renovate zoo it languished for years because restoration needed approval from new york city landmarks preservation commission lpc which had designated several zoo buildings as landmarks
