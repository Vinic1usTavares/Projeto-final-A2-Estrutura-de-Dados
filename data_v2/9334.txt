tales of wonder is a british science fiction magazine published from 1937 to 1942 with walter gillings as editor it was published by world s work a subsidiary of william heinemann as part of a series of genre titles that included tales of mystery and detection and tales of uncanny gillings was able to attract some good material despite low payment rates he was able to offer he also included many reprints from u s science fiction magazines magazine was apparently more successful than other genre titles issued by world s work since tales of wonder was only one to publish more than a single issue arthur c clarke made his first professional sale to tales of wonder with two science articles gillings also published william f temple s first story some early material by john wyndham and prr r eet by eric frank russell american writers who appeared in magazine included murray leinster and jack williamson these were both reprints but some new material from u s did appear including lloyd a eshbach s out of past and s p meek s mentality machine with advent of world war ii paper shortages and gillings call up into army made it increasingly difficult to continue and sixteenth issue dated spring 1942 was last tales of wonder was not first british science fiction magazine but it was first one aimed at an adult market and its success made it apparent that a science fiction magazine could survive in uk publication history first us science fiction sf magazine amazing stories was imported into uk from its launch in 1926 and other magazines from u s market were also available from an early date no british sf magazine appeared until 1934 when pearson s launched scoops a weekly in tabloid format aimed at juvenile market soon haydn dimmock scoops editor began to receive more sophisticated stories targeted at an adult audience he tried to change magazine s focus to include more mature fiction but within twenty issues falling sales led pearson s to cancel magazine failure of scoops gave british publishers impression that britain could not support a science fiction publication ashley 2000 pp 127 131 despite this failure only a year later george newnes ltd publisher of strand magazine decided to launch a group of four genre pulp magazines and to include a science fiction title editor t stanhope sprigg had help from walter gillings a british science fiction reader who had been active in fan circles since early 1930s in searching for good submissions but project was placed on hold after fifteen months ashley 1985a pp 254 256 gillings next approached world s work a subsidiary of william heinemann who were already publishing titles such as tales of mystery and detection and tales of uncanny as part of their master thriller series gillings had heard that world s work were planning a science fiction magazine as it turned out this was not case but gillings was quickly able to persuade them to add science fiction to their list he was asked to prepare a single issue of 80 000 words to test market world s work reprinted a good deal of american fiction and since they were only paying for reprint rights their rates were lower than was usual for new fiction gillings was given a budget of 10 6 ten shillings and sixpence per thousand words low rate discouraged those writers who could sell to better paying american magazines newer writers were glad of chance to develop a british market for their work though most american writers were unimpressed harbottle holland 1992 p 15 first issue of tales of wonder appeared in june 1937 sales were good enough for world s work to continue publication and from spring 1938 magazine appeared on a quarterly schedule with occasional omissions none of other titles in master thriller series ever turned into a separate magazine so it was evidently selling well ashley 1985b pp 652 654 success of tales of wonder led newnes to believe that they had been wrong to turn down gillings and in 1938 they launched fantasy as a competitor outbreak of second world war in 1939 did not immediately lead to paper shortages but paper began to be rationed in april 1940 and page count which had already dropped from 128 to 96 fell to 72 by 1941 gillings was called up for military service and for a while he was able to edit magazine from his army camp but magazine eventually ceased publication with spring 1942 issue contents and reception american science fiction magazines had by mid 1930s begun to publish some more sophisticated stories than straightforward adventure fiction that was a staple of earliest years of genre gillings decided that many british science fiction readers would not be familiar with most of developments in american sf and so he did not make a point of seeking innovative and original material first issue contained perfect creature an early story by john wyndham under name john beynon as well as prr r eet by eric frank russell second issue included wyndham s novel sleepers of mars and william f temple s lunar lilliput which was temple s first science fiction sale stenographer s hands a story by david h keller also appeared in second issue reprinted from a us magazine gillings claimed that this was to introduce british science fiction readers to american developments in sf but in fact it was because he was having trouble obtaining good quality material from british writers other reprints acquired by gillings included murray leinster s mad planet and its sequel red dust and two stories by jack williamson his first sale metal man along with moon era these were both by american writers though gillings tried to reprint stories from us markets by british writers when he could reprints were not restricted to american and british authors or us pulp market gillings also ran planet wrecker by r coutts armour an australian writer who used pseudonym coutts brisbane story had originally appeared in red magazine in 1914 some new stories from american writers appeared including lloyd a eshbach s out of past and s p meek s mentality machine gillings ran competitions for reader essays one of which was won by ken bulmer later a well known british science fiction writer and he encouraged fans to contribute with articles and fillers most significant writer introduced by gillings was undoubtedly arthur c clarke whose first sales were to gillings for science articles man s empire of tomorrow and we can rocket to moon now which were published in winter 1938 and summer 1939 issues science fiction historian mike ashley regards tales of wonder as a lively entertaining and enjoyable magazine its success demonstrated that there was a market in britain for a magazine aimed at adult science fiction readers despite earlier failure of scoops and in 1938
