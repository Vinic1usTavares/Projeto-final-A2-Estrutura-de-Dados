osmaniye class was a group of four ironclad warships built for ottoman navy in 1860s class comprised lead ship and they were first vessels of type to be built for ottoman empire all four were built in great britain first three by robert napier and sons and fourth by thames iron works ships were broadside ironclads carrying a battery of fourteen armstrong guns and ten 36 pounder armstrong guns in a bank of guns on each broadside ships saw little active service in part owing to fact that they were considered too large and thus too valuable to risk during russo turkish war of 1877 1878 ottoman fleet was placed in reserve for following two decades during which four ships of osmaniye class were heavily rebuilt into more modern barbette ships they were in poor condition by outbreak of greco turkish war in 1897 like much of rest of fleet and as a result saw no action during war navy considered rebuilding ships for second time in early 1900s but abandoned idea due to their deteriorated state as a result four ships were decommissioned in 1909 and mahmudiye and orhaniye were broken up in 1913 with osmaniye and aziziye remaining in navy s inventory until 1923 when they too were scrapped design in 1861 abdulaziz became sultan of ottoman empire and thereafter began a construction program to strengthen ottoman navy which had incurred heavy losses during crimean war of 1853 1856 navy ordered ironclad warships from shipyards in britain and france though program was limited by ottoman empire s limited finances osmaniye class were first ironclads to be ordered as part of program

single horizontal compound engine which drove one screw propeller steam was provided by six coal fired box boilers that were trunked into a single retractable funnel amidships their engine produced a top speed of on sea trials though by 1891 decades of poor maintenance had reduced ships speed to osmaniye and her sister ships carried of coal a supplementary barque rig with three masts was also fitted ships were armed with a battery of one rifled muzzle loading rml armstrong gun and fourteen rml armstrongs these were supplemented with ten 36 pounder guns also manufactured by armstrong 229 mm gun was placed on upper deck forward and rest of guns were mounted on each broadside on upper and main decks ships wrought iron armored belt was thick and was capped with thick transverse bulkhead at either end belt extended from above waterline and below amidships with depth of belt reduced to at either end of ship above belt were strakes of armor thick that protected battery transverse bulkheads connected battery armor 229 mm gun in bow was protected by a breastwork that was sheathed with of iron plate modifications in 1884 36 pounder guns were removed and a light battery of four quick firing qf hotchkiss guns and two 4 barreled nordenfelt guns were added all four ships were refitted at imperial arsenal with work lasting from 1890 to 1894 during refit they received two vertical triple expansion engines in place of their original machinery and six coal fired scotch marine boilers replaced box boilers new propulsion system allowed them to steam at a speed of their armament was radically revised all of old muzzle loaders were removed and a battery of new krupp breech loading guns were installed two krupp k l 35 guns were added in individual barbettes one forward and one aft eight l 25 krupp guns and six l 25 krupp guns were installed on broadside two of 47 mm guns were removed and three more nordenfelt guns were added ships shipbuilderlaid downlaunchedcompleted robert

other ironclads of ottoman fleet four osmaniye class ships were kept out of action during russo turkish war of 1877 1878 since they were among largest and most powerful vessels of fleet and high command decided they ought to be preserved as a result they generally remained safely in sea of marmara though osmaniye was briefly used as a troop transport in mediterranean sea sondhaus p guleryuz pp 6 7 194 four ships were reduced to reserve status in constantinople after war with rest of ottoman fleet four ships were heavily rebuilt in early 1890s being converted into more modern barbette ships nevertheless they were in poor condition by outbreak of greco turkish war in february 1897 with many of their guns damaged or incomplete training exercises conducted in may highlighted very low standard of training of their crews and reinforced decision not to confront greek navy at sea langensiepen guleryuz pp 8 9 all four ships were disarmed after war and laid up ottomans began a reconstruction program which was to have included four osmaniye class ships proposed alterations included a new propulsion system and a battery consisting of one 203 mm quick firing gun and nine 150 mm qf guns they were also to receive a new suite of steel armor including a thick belt 127 mm thick barbettes 76 mm gun turrets and a thick deck but ships were found to be not worth rebuilding a second time and so all were ultimately decommissioned in 1909 aziziye orhaniye and mahmudiye were briefly used as barracks ships latter two were sold for scrap in 1913 and aziziye and osmaniye followed them to ship breakers in 1923 langensiepen guleryuz pp 9 10 133 notes references category osmaniye class ironclads category 1860s ships
