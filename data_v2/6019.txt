felt performing slow torch songs really claustrophobic during their jam sessions improvisation became a major part of group s approach to recording black cherry album focuses more heavily on dance music and glam rock inspired synthesisers than its predecessor and is influenced by spanish disco group baccara and swedish techno artist hakan lidbo goldfrapp commented that album differs from felt mountain because band wanted to put more kind of oomph in it she stated that lyrics are a lot more direct and less ambiguous songs on black cherry are more forthright in describing sexuality than

how to draw you in and more importantly hook you rolling stones pat noted that t ons of bands imitate sounds of early eighties but goldfrapp use new wave as a way to evoke a long history of shiny euro lounge music spin commented that on black cherry duo downplay cinematic strings in favor of buzzing live wire synths and singer alison goldfrapp still wails like kate bush haunting a fog soaked moor mojo praised album as lucid and ambiguous beautifully schizophrenic and poised on edge of ruin dorian lynskey of blender wrote although a few tracks retain felt mountains eerie beauty black natural habitat is less supper club than strip club and goldfrapp sound right at home andy hermann of popmatters viewed black cherry as a weird edgy album work of two doggedly maverick talents chasing their muses wherever they take them wes may of about com dubbed it a rare electronica album of warmth and depth and ultimate chillout pleasure drowned in sounds gen williams expressed that album s crystalline neon edged beauty its pulsing army of beats and alison s lush lethargically versatile vocals swinging between sultry and seraphic throughout make it for now at least a largely satisfying record that indicates imminent and deserved success for goldfrapp q deemed album thoroughly likeable despite its inconsistency in a mixed review heather phares of allmusic commended goldfrapp for their artistic risk taking but felt that album sounds unbalanced swinging between delicate deceptively icy ballads and heavier dance inspired numbers without finding much of a happy medium between
