aerodramus is a genus of small dark cave nesting birds in tribe of swift family its members are confined to tropical and subtropical regions in southern asia oceania and northeastern australia many of its members were formerly classified in collocalia but were first placed in a separate genus by american ornithologist harry church oberholser in 1906 itis standard report page for aerodramus this is a taxonomically difficult group of very similar species echolocation dna sequencing and parasitic lice have all been used to establish relationships but some problems such as placement of papuan swiftlet are not fully resolved these swiftlets can pose major identification problems where several species occur what distinguishes aerodramus swiftlets from other swifts and indeed almost all other birds is their ability to use a simple but effective form of echolocation this enables them to navigate within breeding and roosting caves nests of aerodramus swiftlets are constructed with saliva as a major component in two species saliva is only material used and nests are collected for famous chinese delicacy bird s nest soup over collection of which puts pressure on swiftlet populations distribution range of these swiftlets is confined to tropical southern asia oceania northeastern australia and indian ocean with greatest diversity in southeast asia indonesia and papua new guinea several of species are restricted to small islands and their limited range can make them vulnerable like seychelles whitehead s and guam swiftlets birdlife international species factsheet collocalia

2007 mangaia swiftlet is a recently extinct species known only from fossils description thumb left white rumped swiftlet in flight aerodramus swiftlets are in many respects typical swifts having narrow wings for fast flight and a wide gape and small reduced beak surrounded by bristles for catching insects in flight they have dull plumage which is mainly in shades of black brown and grey members of this genus typically have dark brown upper wings and upper body sometimes with a paler rump light brown underparts a paler throat and brownish white under wings with dark brown armpits males and female plumages are similar in appearance as is that of juvenile for those species for which it has been described in some species juvenile shows pale fringes to flight feathers legs as with many swifts are very short preventing birds from perching but allowing them to cling to vertical surfaces flight is mainly gliding due to very long primary feathers and small breast muscles aerodramus swiftlets depending on species weigh 8 35 0 28 1 23 oz and are 9 16 centimetres 0 28 1 23 in long these swiftlets are very similar and where several species occur such as borneo new guinea and philippines may not be separable in field behaviour juvenile german s swiftlet thumb right these juvenile german s swiftlets have fallen from nests and are being reared by hand aerodramus swiftlets are aerial insectivores which take prey like flies on wing they roost and breed in caves during day they leave caves to forage for food and return to roost at night they are monogamous and both partners take part in caring for nestlings males perform aerial displays to attract females and mating occurs at nest breeding season overlaps wet season which corresponds to an increased insect population clutch size depends on location and food source but generally aerodramus swiftlets lay one or two eggs eggs are a dull white and are laid every other day many if not all species are colonial nesters some build their nests in high dark corners on cave walls most aerodramus swiftlets live in tropical indo pacific region and do not migrate these birds usually remain in one cave or other roosting nesting site examples of cave sites include niah caves and gunung mulu national park which are both located in sarawak malaysian borneo characteristics of behaviour such as what materials apart from saliva nests contain can be used to differentiate between certain species of aerodramus echolocation niah cave a swiftlet nesting site thumb left genus aerodramus is of special interest due to its use of echolocation swiftlets use this technique to navigate in darkness through chasms and shafts of caves where they breed and roost at night apart from swiftlets only other avian species to use echolocation is unrelated aerodramus swiftlets echolocating double clicks are within normal human hearing range and up to 3 milliseconds apart with interval becoming shorter in darker locations unlike rest of genus for those species which have been studied atiu swiftlet aerodramus sawtelli and black nest swiftlet a maximus emit only single clicks former species also uses echolocation outside its caves use of echolocation was once used to separate aerodramus from other non echolocating cave swiftlet genera collocalia and hydrochous virtually nothing is known about however recently pygmy swiftlet collocalia troglodytes was discovered making similar clicking noises both inside and outside its roosting cave it has recently been determined that echolocation vocalizations do not agree with evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by dna sequence comparison this suggests that as in bats echolocation sounds once present adapt rapidly and independently to particular species acoustic environment a study suggested that echolocation subunits were mainly located in central nervous system while subunits in vocal apparatus were already present and capable of use before echolocation even evolved this study supports hypothesis of independent evolution of echolocation in aerodramus and collocalia with subsequent evolution of complex behaviour needed to complement physical echolocation system or just possibly that vocal apparatus parts of echolocation system might even be inherited from some prehistoric nocturnal ancestor it has been suggested that giant or waterfall swiftlet hydrochous gigas which cannot echolocate may be descended from an echolocating ancestor saliva nests thumb an edible nest intricately constructed saliva nests of this swiftlet genus which in some species contain no other material are collected to make delicacy bird s nest soup they therefore command extremely high prices authentic bird s nest soup is made from nests of edible nest swiftlet or white nest swiftlet aerodramus fuciphagus and black nest swiftlet aerodramus maximus instead of incorporating twigs feathers and straw like others in genus these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva which harden when exposed to air once nests are harvested they are cleaned and sold to restaurants over past twenty years high demand for nests of these aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations niah caves population of black nest swiftlets plunged from around 1 5 million pairs in 1959 to 150 000 298 000 pairs in early 1990s through over harvesting early authors had doubts about material used to make nest with whale and fish sperm and sea foam being proposed as basis for construction even in 1830s when use of saliva had been fairly well established it was believed that it was only a cement to bind a sea plant which provided bulk of gelatinous material of nest lice as with other taxonomically difficult groups ectoparasites can give information on relationships page r d m lee p l m becher s a griffiths r clayton d h 1997 a different tempo of evolution in birds and their parasitic lice text retrieved 12 nov 2007 a study of swiftlet parasites in northern borneo involved transferring lice between closely related swiftlet species survival of lice in most of these transfers was significantly reduced in proportion to mean difference in feather barb size between donor and recipient species of hosts thus adaptation to a particular resource on body of host appears to govern specificity of swiftlet lice in transfers where lice survived lice moved to different areas on body of host where mean barb diameter of feathers on which lice occurred had required value papuan swiftlet papuan swiftlet aerodramus papuensis has three toes instead of usual four in this group it has ability to echolocate but whereas other previously studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night it uses single not double clicks dna sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between a papuensis and other aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and waterfall swift hydrochous gigas are sister taxa a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of genus aerodramus species in taxonomic order thumb john latham figure of swallow and its nest seychelles swiftlet aerodramus mascarene swiftlet aerodramus indian swiftlet
