alloxylon flammeum commonly known as queensland tree waratah or red silky oak is a medium sized tree of family proteaceae found in queensland tropical rain forests of northeastern australia it has shiny green elliptical leaves up to 18 cm 7 2 in long and prominent orange red inflorescences that appear from august to october followed by rectangular woody seed pods that ripen in february and march juvenile plants have large up to 25 cm 10 in long deeply lobed pinnate leaves previously known as oreocallis wickhamii initial specimen turned out to be a different species to one cultivated and hence a new scientific name was required described formally by peter weston and mike crisp in 1991 a flammeum was designated type species of genus alloxylon this genus contains four species previously classified in oreocallis that are found in australasia alloxylon flammeum is a canopy or emergent tree of mabi rainforest community of north queensland its terminal tubular flowers indicate that species is pollinated by birds readily adaptable to cultivation alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus it is listed nationally as vulnerable under australian environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 epbc act as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging description thumb left inflorescences royal botanic gardens sydney in nature this is a rainforest tree that can reach 33 m 108 ft in height with a diameter at breast height dbh of 0 6 m 24 in although in cultivation 10 m 35 ft is more likely trunk has light grey bark with brown lenticels new branchlets and leaves are hairy green foliage consists of several distinct juvenile and adult leaf forms which are arranged alternately along stems very young plants begin with their first two to four leaves having two or three lobes but then have narrow elliptic leaves with entire margins measuring 6 5 to 18 cm 2 6 7 2 in long and 1 3 2 2 cm 0 5 0 8 in wide these are then succeeded by pinnate juvenile leaves that have two to nine lobes arising at 30 to 40 degrees forwards and reach 50 cm 20 in long they have prominent along midline of main leaf and lobes elliptic or obovate egg shaped adult leaves are 8 25 cm 3 2 10 in long and up to 4 5 cm 1 8 in wide and sit on 1 5 to 2 5 cm 0 6 1 in long petioles occurring in spring august to october bright red or orange red inflorescences are terminal and well displayed and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers arranged in a corymb flowers sit atop stalks known as pedicels up to 3 5 cm 1 6 in in length which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within inflorescence each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4 cm 1 8 in long which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release thick style stigma is contained within a slanting disc like structure at tip of style tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip and anther lies in concave parts within each of these segments pedicel and outer surface of perianth are pubescent covered in short fine fur flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks and are 7 10 cm 2 8 4 in long each pod contains 8 to 10 seeds and is ripe in february and march each seed is separated from others by a membranous separator and has a long rectangular wing which is much longer than seed itself seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0 8 1 cm 0 3 0 4 in wide by 1 cm 0 4 in long alloxylon flammeum can be distinguished from co occurring alloxylon wickhamii by its hairy stems and petioles it also has brighter flowers than latter species new guinean species a brachycarpum resembles a flammeum but has duller flowers leaves that are shorter and wider and fewer hairs on its perianth a pinnatum has pinnate lobed adult leaves and larger inflorescences made up of 50 to 140 individual flowers it also has crimson pollen rather than yellow of a flammeum taxonomy for many years alloxylon flammeum was mistakenly known as embothrium and later oreocallis wickhamii queensland botanist frederick manson bailey had illustrated it using embothrium wickhamii in queensland agricultural journal in 1899 ferdinand von mueller had described what is now known as alloxylon wickhamii but also collected material of a flammeum at trinity bay in 1881 not realising it was a separate species it was only in 1980s that botanists realised there were two species in region oreocallis wickhamii and what became known as oreocallis sp nova peter weston and mike crisp of royal botanic gardens in sydney reviewed and recognised australian members of genus oreocallis as distinct from their south american counterparts and hence reallocated them to new genus alloxylon in 1991 they coined binomial name of alloxylon flammeum type material having been collected by garry and peter radke from scrub in august 1987 weston and crisp designated it type species of genus alloxylon aside from tree waratah it has also been called satin oak pink silky oak satin silky oak red silky oak red oak lowland bull oak and queensland waratah genus name is derived from ancient greek allo other or strange and xylon wood and refers to their unusual cell architecture compared with related genera telopea and oreocallis species name flammeum is latin for flame coloured alloxylon flammeum and other three tree waratah species lie in subtribe embothriinae along with true waratahs telopea south american oreocallis and chilean firetree embothrium coccineum from south america almost all these species have red terminal flowers and hence subtribe s origin and floral appearance most likely predate splitting of gondwana into australia antarctica and south america over 60 million years ago position colour and tubular shape of flowers suggest they are bird pollinated and have been so since eocene radiation of nectar feeding birds such as honeyeaters cladistic analysis of morphological features within embothriinae showed a flammeum and a brachycarpum to be sister species with a wickhamii as their next closest relative a flammeum has yellow pollen grains like a brachycarpum and a wickhamii but unlike all other members of embothriinae distribution and habitat a plant of wet tropics bioregion alloxylon flammeum is found on atherton tablelands in far north queensland at altitudes of above sea level its range is from danbulla to upper barron river though most of its rainforest habitat has been cleared for agriculture and it is found in protected remnants such as mount national park danbulla national park crater lakes national park curtain fig tree national park and hill conservation park found on basalt or granite based soil it is a component of complex vine forest or rainforest where it is a canopy or emergent tree this forest also known as mabi forest has an uneven canopy layer to around 45 m 100 ft and significant scrub understory here alloxylon flammeum is found with such species as candlenut aleurites argyrodendron spp lawyer cane calamus rose maple cryptocarya shining leaved stinging tree dendrocnide fig trees ficus spp queensland maple flindersia cabbage northern brush mahogany atherton turkey bush frutescens and red cedar toona ciliata conservation status alloxylon flammeum is listed nationally as vulnerable under australian environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 epbc act which indicates that there is a high risk it will become extinct in wild in mid term future before establishment of epbc act it was and currently remains listed as vulnerable under state based nature conservation act 1992 furthermore it was listed by international union for conservation of nature iucn in 1997 most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and development remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented furthermore plants in cultivation are likely to come from a limited genetic pool with under 2 of its original extent remaining rainforest is threatened by invasive plants and grazing by feral and domestic animals cultivation thumb left sulfur crested cockatoo in foliage although it is not widely cultivated alloxylon flammeum has proven to be by far most hardy and adaptable as well as showiest member of genus alloxylon and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as victoria it does best in a well drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young applying mulch to soil around plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage plant though fertilisers specifically for australian native plants can be used yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate its flowers attract birds to gardens a large tree grows in royal botanic gardens in sydney it is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in wild propagation is generally by seed although semi hardened cuttings have also been successful cuttings can be slow to strike and resulting plants may have weak root systems early on and need to be supported with stakes semi hardened cuttings have been most successful in experiments applying rooting hormone indole 3 butyric acid at 8000 milligrams per litre concentration intermittent misting and a warmer root temperature of plants grown from seed may take seven or eight years to flower with flowering occurring soon after foliage changes from juvenile to adult leaves an alternative method used has been to graft mature scions onto young stock to combine a strong root system with material capable of flowering quickly species has also been considered as a rootstock for considerably harder to grow a pinnatum alloxylon flammeum has potential as a cut flower crop its soft silky timber resembles that of oak and is highly regarded
