cry of love tour was a 1970 concert tour by american rock guitarist and singer jimi hendrix it began on april 25 1970 at forum in inglewood california and ended on september 6 1970 at love peace festival in fehmarn germany majority of 37 shows were in united states with two each in sweden denmark and germany and one in england where hendrix was final act at isle of wight festival 1970 after experimenting with different lineups following breakup of jimi hendrix experience hendrix brought back experience drummer mitch mitchell with bassist billy cox replacing noel redding to record and tour hendrix continued to perform experience numbers along with newer material from live band of gypsys album and songs that he was developing for a fourth album soon after their performance at isle of wight tour was cut short due to cox s illness and hendrix was left considering his options however he died twelve days after fehmarn concert several concerts were recorded and filmed that were later released on albums and film since their debut in 1971 berkeley atlanta and isle of wight performances have been reissued several times most recently as blue wild angel live at isle of wight 2002 live at berkeley 2003 and freedom atlanta pop festival jimi hendrix electric church 2015 concert selections continue to be included on hendrix retrospectives and documentaries such as voodoo child jimi hendrix collection 2001 which contains five songs recorded during tour background following noel redding s departure from experience on june 29 1969 hendrix called on billy cox an army buddy and early bandmate to play bass in july hendrix cox and experience drummer mitch mitchell moved to a rural retreat in upstate new york and began rehearsing with an expanded lineup which included rhythm guitarist larry lee and percussionists juma sultan and jerry velez one month later group debuted at woodstock festival after a couple of gigs and recording sessions it became apparent that group sometimes referred to as gypsy sun and rainbows after a comment hendrix made at woodstock was not making sufficient progress hendrix still wanted to experiment with a different backup but return to trio configuration so drummer buddy miles replaced mitchell with cox remaining on bass however new trio often called band of gypsys was similarly short lived hendrix s tour manager gerry stickells believed jimi s own lack of commitment to band of gypsys concept was its fatal flaw hendrix expressed his dissatisfaction with subsequent band of gypsys live album and cox saw it as a stopgap measure to meet a contractual obligation with return of mitchell alongside cox hendrix s latest group had only one member change from either experience or band of gypsys a new name for group was never officially adopted but concert promoters often billed them as jimi hendrix experience later group was informally referred to as cry of love and name was used as title for first posthumous collection of hendrix s new songs cry of love with march june 1970 releases in us and uk of woodstock film and soundtrack and band of gypsys hendrix remained one of biggest rock concert attractions in an interview shortly after tour began hendrix explained i called tour cry of love because that is what it s all about i d like to play some festivals but i wish they would break up events a bit for audiences there s no reason why these huge crowds should not be entertained by side as well during this period demonstrations riots and clashes with police occurred at several concerts some of hendrix s performances were met with demands that they be free events such at berkeley community theatre may 30 and new york pop festival july 17 where they led to violent confrontations at this time hendrix was also writing and recording songs for a planned fourth studio album in early june after many delays his new recording facility electric lady studios was operational hendrix was able to get his manager michael jeffery to agree to limit his concert appearances to three day weekends so group could return to new york city to record during rest of week there were some stretches when group took time off they only performed twice between may 10 and june 5 three gigs were cancelled due to illness and twice between june 27 and july 17 group spent most of august recording at electric lady before official opening party on august 26 afterwards hendrix departed for england and european segment of tour for his first appearance in england in eighteen months hendrix was one of top billed events at isle of wight festival 1970 a few dates later cox became ill and had to return to us to recover so after performing at only seven european concerts tour was cancelled hendrix stayed in london where he attended parties and jammed with other musicians he was considering whether to find a new bass player and met with chas chandler producer of are you experienced and axis bold as love however hendrix died on september 18 1970 repertoire throughout tour hendrix continued to perform experience material and introduced several newer songs purple haze and voodoo child slight return were frequent concert closers foxey lady red house fire and hey joe were concert staples as they had been in experience performances hendrix also continued to perform popular songs that dated back to experience but not yet recorded to his satisfaction such as lover man hear my train a comin and roomful of mirrors from his time with cox and miles he added machine gun message to love and ezy ryder hendrix also had a number of new songs that were still in development that he chose to include in his concerts freedom and hey baby new rising sun were among most played new numbers others such as straight ahead in from storm dolly dagger and midnight lightning were performed occasionally songs signaled a new direction in hendrix s music which biographer john mcdermott describes as music of a more mature and refined experience reflecting a more subtle and intricate approach biographer david moskowitz identifies songs performed on july 26 at sick s stadium in seattle washington hendrix s birthplace as representative of cry of love repertoire fire message to love lover man machine gun star spangled banner purple haze hear my train a comin voodoo child slight return hey baby new rising sun freedom red house foxey lady despite being one of his best selling singles hendrix usually ignored requests for all along watchtower during his tours with experience however after song s debut at swing auditorium in san bernardino california on june 20 he performed it more often cox wished to delve deeper into hendrix s catalogue i wanted to play those songs i wanted him to play crosstown traffic but we never got around to rehearsing it however hendrix occasionally surprised him at a may 16 gig at temple university in philadelphia pennsylvania cox recalled hendrix also performed johnny b goode
