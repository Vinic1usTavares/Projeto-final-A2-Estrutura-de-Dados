jewel staite who was only 13 at time looked old enough to play role of a 15 year old girl 160px thumb right screenplay for oubliette was authored by charles grant craig a writer who at time had little background or experience within television kenneth muir 2001 p 1997 p 392 before joining writing staff of x files during third season his most significant writing credits included episodes for renegade and booker his most notable television screenplay was new alfred hitchcock presents entry final escape m lentz 2001 p muir 2001 p 149 though craig left staff shortly before oubliette entered

consisting of total darkness with a hole that opens from top hatfield 1997 p 1996 p 120 narrative centers on mulder s identification with lucy which is based on abduction of his sister samantha it was decided that time would not be spent on scully s sympathy with victim despite her own abduction experience in second season episode ascension despite this scully is gentle towards mulder and wanted to believe him until evidence pointed overwhelmingly to lucy after that point scully takes on an antagonistic role going against wishes of her partner though not originally included in script david duchovny added line about how his connection to case was not just because of samantha series creator chris carter stated that in craig s original draft lucy was more hard boiled but actress tracey ellis played her as a more wounded person fox s standards and practices department was uncomfortable with screenplay because it featured a 12 year old girl being kidnapped network requested that she be in her late teens and that plot would not heavily feature amy s ordeal or suffering jewel staite had just turned 13 when she was cast but producers thought that she looked older and even applied make up to add to that effect lowry 1995 p 1995 p 121 reason for concern was because original screenplay featured similarities to polly klaas case which had received large public attention around time of production polly klaas was a 12 year old girl who was kidnapped during a slumber party and eventually strangled to death antagonist of episode was compared to richard allen davis culprit of case who was convicted and sentenced to death for his crimes genge in his novel unofficial x files companion commented that tragically unlike amy klaas didn t survive her abduction genge 1995 p 79 filming alt view of a mountain landscape episode was filmed at mount seymour because it was only location that met all conditions of crew 220px thumb left oubliette was shot in vancouver british columbia as were rest of episodes of third season location of antagonist s house was an important factor during production craig s screenplay called for a remote house in middle of nowhere but producers required a site closer to studio gradnitzer 2002 p 90 with a production crew consisting of 60 members it was decided to use somewhere that could appear rustic while being next to a parking lot a suitable area was found near peak of mount seymour a location that had previously been used in ascension gradnitzer 2002 p 66 mountain featured both a parking lot and a log cabin that met needs of filming crew an issue arose because mountain had a ski lift which needed to be avoided while composing shots over 1000 prop trees had to be brought to filming site to camouflage surroundings to give atmosphere a remote feel lowry 1996 p 21 crew encountered a larger issue with contract with provincial park committee park required a seven day notice before filming of any kind was approved production manager had to contact park representative directly who assured him that their needs would be met gradnitzer 2002 p 91 for final sequence both capilano river and lynn headwaters were considered however seymour river was ultimately chosen because it was safest filming location filming of episode was plagued by rain and heavy weather conditions in one example while directing climax river had risen by four or five inches causing crew to move to another position to shoot at a week later this cost crew several days worth of production and a large sum of money shooting conditions were further complicated because shoots involving water are notably difficult requiring a new set of costumes for each take because of extensive outdoor shooting director kim manners hated directing episode commenting that it couldn t be fucking worse despite a negative experience with shooting on mountain episode gethsemane from fourth season was filmed there with similar issues meisler 2000 p 270 gillian anderson s stand

represents logic of duplication genge 1995 p 78 wade treats both girls in virtually identical ways kidnapping them and photographing them obsessively in same manner macintyre 1997 p 108 david lavery in deny all knowledge asserts that mulder is capable of seeing beyond simple equivalents caring about each individual girl separately lavery 1996 p 203 lavery argues that this grants mulder ability to separate case from his own personal experience with his sister scene that best exemplifies this trait is when mulder attempts to comfort amy s mother following her daughter s kidnapping mulder comments that he knows how she feels not because of what happened to his sister but because he can identify with her general sense of loss hatfield 1997 p 169 thematic elements concerning concept of
