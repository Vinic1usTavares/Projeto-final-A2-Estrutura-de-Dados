battle of hill 70 took place in world war i between canadian corps and four divisions of german 6th army battle took place along western front on outskirts of lens in nord pas de calais region of france between 15 and 25 august 1917 objectives of assault were to inflict casualties and to draw german troops away from 3rd battle of ypres and to make german hold on lens untenable canadian corps executed an operation to capture hill 70 and then establish defensive positions from which combined small arms and artillery fire some of which used new technique of predicted fire would repel german counter attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible goals of canadian corps were only partially accomplished germans were prevented from transferring local divisions to ypres salient but failed to draw in troops from other areas a later attempt by canadian corps to extend its position into city of lens failed but german and canadian assessments of battle concluded that it succeeded in its attrition objective battle was costly for both sides and many casualties were suffered from extensive use of poison gas including new german yellow cross shell containing blistering agent sulphur mustard mustard gas background western front by may 1917 nivelle offensive despite successful opening of battle of arras had come to a disastrous conclusion with french army mutinies on 30 april as french hesitated to continue second battle of aisne 16 april 9 may 1917 commander of british expeditionary force field marshal sir douglas haig gave orders to first army general henry horne to advance towards lens to gain a line from mericourt to sallaumines hill lens and hill 70 horne already desired to cut off salient containing lens to shorten front while unwilling to risk a costly and slow frontal assault into maze of ruins first army was understrength after battle of arras but after german operation withdrawal to hindenburg line in march there was some hope that 6th army general otto von below could be manoeuvred out of lens by gradual advances to capture higher ground to south west and north of city on 7 may haig informed british army commanders that french had terminated nivelle offensive and strategy of returning to a war of manoeuvre operations to exhaust powers of resistance of german armies would resume by systematic surprise attacks and when this was complete british would begin an offensive at ypres to capture belgian coast and reach frontier with netherlands objectives of first army were unchanged but instead of capturing ground around lens to shorten front intention was to menace german hold on lens and defences south of lille to distract divert and weaken defenders operations were not a diversion but a means to keep first army front active for as long as possible to mislead germans as to british intentions in flanders on 8 may horne told corps commanders that lens thumb from vimy ridge ground declines about into douai plain valley of souchez river is about wide and flows south west to north east through south of city of lens in 1914 river had several road and rail bridges by 1917 much of city was derelict due to years of artillery bombardments ruins being natural strongpoints overlooked by slag heaps and several hills including hill 70 hill 65 and sallaumines hill city is in a shallow saucer shaped depression surrounded by and hills to south east on terrain that is above sea level sallaumines hill rises to on west side of lens is hill 65 reservoir hill north of souchez which is steep sided and gives a fine view of city to north west on east side of lens bethune road is a hill about high with suburb of cite st pierre on top hill 70 is north of city and has a flat top giving a fine view of city and ground to north and east hill slopes gently towards lens and there is a shallow depression between it and cite st pierre slopes of hill 70 towards cite st auguste are steeper lens hill 70 sallaumines and sallaumines hill to south east and their commanding views over area and city fell under german control in october 1914 during race to sea in september 1915 british overran hill during battle of loos but it was recaptured by germans local operations horne began to make plans for capture of lens during third battle of scarpe 3 4 may horne wanted canadian corps to continue its operations east of vimy ridge to capture mericourt and la which would endanger german defences of sallaumines hill south east of lens as i corps lieutenant general arthur holland north of souchez with twelve tanks captured hill 65 reservoir hill and hill 70 attacks would envelop lens on three sides and give forward observation officers foo sight of german defences in city potentially to force 6th army to retire without need for a frontal attack in may holland had surveyed i corps front noted that tactical value of hill 70 and that it would be inevitable that germans would make great efforts to re capture hill german counter attacks could only be resisted if plenty of reserves and much artillery support were made available deliberate attacks to capture high ground around lens would meet goals of first army despite its limited means in may and early june first army units conducted eighteen raids and minor actions moving front line slowly eastwards over douai plain by 6 june first army had captured all high ground in area except that around lens i corps was west of city from souchez north to hill 65 reservoir hill through and along ridge of 70 metre hill to north of cite st pierre on 9 june commander of canadian corps lieutenant general julian byng was promoted and assumed command third army arthur currie 1st canadian division commander was promoted in his place on 10 june holland told horne that only capture of hill 70 was important and suggested inflicting mass casualties by raids bombardments and gas attacks to create impression that a big attack was imminent defenders would be subjected to anxiety and have to move more troops and artillery to hill despite inevitable losses horne doubted that army had sufficient men and artillery for task and arranged for 46th north midland division on right of i corps to make preparations to take hill 70 and vicinity but only if reinforcements from ghq were forthcoming while waiting i corps would capture hill 65 and south of souchez xiii corps and right hand divisions of canadian corps would prepare to attack from gavrelle to oppy fresnoy and mericourt digging jumping off trenches to simulate a threat to lens from south real attack was to come from left flank of canadian corps towards sallaumines hill and east end of avion success would trap germans in lens between sallaumines hill to south and hill 70 to north if 6th army did not retire preparations by i corps at hill 70 would make it impossible to predict from which direction next attack would come affairs south of souchez thumb to create a threat to lens horne intended that xiii corps on southern flank would attack to reach better positions between villages of gavrelle and oppy by advancing front line for on a front 4th canadian division on left flank of canadian corps south of souchez river a tributary of and 46th north midland division on right of i corps north of river were to attack on a front of to eliminate a german salient from avion to west end of lens and to occupy hill 65 reservoir hill i corps was to plan for an attack on hill 70 with 6th division on left northern flank horne expected that operations would take place in early july but found that many of best heavy guns were to be sent to flanders and brought forward date to 28 june plans were made less ambitious xiii corps scheme was retained but attack either side of souchez was reduced to capture german front line west of avion and hill 65 hill 70 plan was postponed 28 june was dull humid and storm clouds appeared in south over afternoon first army artillery assisted by third army guns en route to flanders began a bombardment along army front from gavrelle to hulluch simulation of a much bigger attack on lens was enhanced by lightning thunder and a downpour which began at when infantry advance began adjacent brigades of 31st and 5th divisions had been bombarded in their jumping off trenches at and suffered 200 casualties before advance began survivors moved so fast that when a german counter barrage fell on no man s land three minutes later british were on far side and unharmed attackers suffered few casualties took and counted german soldiers gavrelle mill and a new line was consolidated despite rainstorm from which areas to north east and east around and could be observed along with greenland hill to south west capture of avion thumb orders from first army hq reached currie on 12 june who replied with a suggestion that capture of hill 65 was tactically desirable to gain observation over lens and to deprive germans of reciprocal observation of british rear capture of avion could be replaced by a raid to avoid casualties of a permanent occupation preparations for offensive operations towards avion would be more meaningful to german observers than attack which followed suggested alternative was not well received by major general w h anderson first army chief of staff because one purpose of operation was to threaten lille which could only occur with capture of lens after attack on avion canadian operation was only a stage in plan to be followed by an attack or decoy towards sallaumines hill a few days later more artillery was transferred to flanders which led to postponement of hill 70 attack further north opposite 4th canadian and 46th north midland divisions german 56th division had on 22 june moved into reserve to substitute for a division transferred to flanders division holding line had orders to retire from salient to avion lens railway if pressed western slopes of hill 65 had been occupied on 24 june after a german retirement and patrols pushed forward towards avion trench which was taken early on 28 june divisions made ready to resume advance when army barrage began at most of avion dit and eastern slope of hill 65 was captured as 3rd canadian division formed a defensive flank along avion road joining with 4th canadian division in avion rain and flooding from souchez stopped patrols from probing german main line of resistance in north eastern part of avion and along a railway embankment about further on prelude first army thumb location of lens canadian corps lieutenant general arthur currie had 1st 2nd and 4th canadian divisions for attack and 3rd canadian division in reserve artillery planning was delegated to major alan brooke who had 240 18 pounder field guns and 78 4 5 inch howitzers of canadian corps field artillery 31 of 18 pounders being unusable due to barrel wear i corps contributed twelve more 18 pounders and xiii corps eighteen brooke also had 38 batteries of heavy siege howitzers consisting of twenty 9 2 inch howitzers twenty 8 inch howitzers eighty 6 inch howitzers 42 60 pounder guns and two 6 inch guns british contributed 28 batteries but approximately 25 per cent of heavy artillery for operation was of dubious value due to barrel wear twenty batteries were in three heavy artillery groups hags for destructive bombardment and 18 batteries in three hags for counter battery fire four british and two canadian 6th army 6th army was responsible for defence of area between lille and cambrai lens being about halfway between town was an important railway junction and after battle of arras earlier in 1917 had become a salient in german defences hill 70 and vicinity was held by 7th division part of headquarters of iv corps german army had begun to use corps headquarters as territorial command units rather than of a permanent complement of divisions during battle of somme lens was garrisoned by 11th reserve division in vi corps in anticipation of an attack army group crown prince rupprecht had moved 4th guard division and 220th division into 6th army area in reserve divisions in reserve rehearsed reinforcement and counter attacks with two front divisions below having written of an expected canadian attack on 15 july plan on 7 july due to a lack of artillery currie was ordered to take over more of line to north and to attack objectives west of lens not taken by 46th north midland division from 29 june and 2 july in south canadian corps was to attack beyond avion to a railway embankment ready to advance to sallaumines hill soon afterwards ghq announced that more artillery would be forthcoming and horne met corps commanders again on 10 july currie wanted to make main effort north of souchez canadian corps taking responsibility for front from avion to hill 70 horne agreed and on 11 july currie issued first orders for attack canadian plan for 30 july used i corps plan for abortive june attack as a basis scheduled attack to embankment east of avion was to go ahead to obtain a good jumping off point for a later advance on sallaumines hill to mislead defenders about preparations for an attack from 11 to 19 july canadian corps intelligence discovered that german dispositions had changed a new third defensive line had been completed along northern outskirts of city from cinnabar trench along nun s alley norman trench hugo trench to bois hugo beyond objectives given to currie on 10 july position had three thick belts of barbed wire a light railway for supply and eleven strongpoints with fields of fire into commotion trench final canadian objective new position was judged to have become main german defence line hill 70 overlooked lens and douai plain and currie believed that germans would commit troops that they could ill afford to lose to regain a position that they dared not leave in canadian possession artillery observers on hill could defeat german counter attacks with accurate artillery fire hill was to be occupied quickly and strongpoint defensive positions were to be established around allocated to each brigade a combination of small arms and artillery firepower would defeat german counter attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible 1st and 2nd canadian divisions were to attack on a front of to a depth of and capture main enemy defensive positions on eastern reverse slope of hill 70 in first stage first objective of attackers was german front line second objective blue line was german second position on crest of hill and third objective green line was german third line on far slope about from start line 3rd canadian infantry brigade of 1st canadian division would attack north of hill 70 and its 2nd canadian infantry brigade would attack summit 4th and 5th canadian infantry brigades of 2nd canadian division would attack ruins of suburbs and directly south of hill by 16 july 1st canadian division infantry had transferred from south west of lens to north western fringe of hill 70 on 22 july divisional artillery arrived and by 25 july was in position from south of lievin to bully among mine workings slag heaps and ruined villages many next to light rail lines canadians having inherited preliminary work done by i corps wire cutting had been going on since 11 july but there was no time for fifteen day preliminary bombardment laid down in artillery plan of 11 july on 26 july last orders were issued and a document canadian corps scheme of operations by brigadier general general staff percy radcliffe set 30 july as date of attack to coincide with flanders offensive heavy rains reduced area to a swamp grounded rfc which provided information on progress of bombardment some guns were late arriving and others had too many defects to use for wire cutting attack was postponed and despite mediocre state of many of guns bombardment continued into august and several creeping barrages were fired to provoke german counter barrages and reveal german gun positions 15th 50th and 2nd canadian heavy artillery group bombarded german gun positions revealed by aerial photographs flash spotting and sound ranging neutralisation being more effective than destruction artillery for eighteen pounders and forty eight were to fire a creeping barrage 1st canadian division front eighteen pounders from 1st and 3rd canadian divisional artilleries and thirty field guns from british 14th army brigade royal field artillery rfa six from 53rd battery and six from 112th battery 2nd canadian division had its eighteen pounders and another eighteen pounders of 46th north midland divisional artillery twelve 18 pounders of 179th army field brigade and another 120th 165th and 317th batteries all of 4 5 inch howitzers were from 2nd canadian divisional artillery making sixty canadian and guns attack had guns and howitzers with guns and howitzers with shells and more than artillery rounds canadian corps heavy artillery hq had 63rd 64th heavy artillery groups hag with eight siege batteries each and canadian heavy artillery group with five for wire cutting and trench destruction barrel wear and general unreliability meant that about half of 18 pounders could not be used in preliminary bombardment eighteen pounders were to fire first layer of creeping barrage with infantry advancing about behind to make it harder for german artillery to bombard infantry by following creeping barrage rest of 18 pounders and some 4 5 inch howitzers were to fire a barrage further forward 6 inch and 9 2 inch howitzers were to fire beyond second barrage line 50th and 2nd canadian heavy artillery group had pieces from 60 pounder guns to 9 2 inch howitzers and four super heavy 12 inch gun and one 15 inch howitzer 12 inch guns had ammunition for eighty rounds per day per gun for fifteen days high explosive gas and shrapnel shells were to be fired at german gun positions revealed by rfc reconnaissance photographs and flash spotters and sound rangers to kill gunners and supply horses one report had 6th army artillery in nine groups of half of them field and half heavy guns and on eve of attack counter batteries claimed that forty of 102 german guns had been knocked out many of field guns were beyond range of hill 70 but i corps on northern left flank and xiii corps on southern right flank were to induce german guns to reply to harassing fire counter batteries were also to be used to destroy german counter attacks and soon after zero hour guns from bombardment hags were to join in with counter battery hags against german infantry counter attacks forward observation observers were to accompany canadian infantry and establish observation posts connected to rear with telephones wireless and visual signalling equipment to direct artillery gas by 1917 gas was delivered by shell substances being classed as lethal harassing and persistent lethal types were chlorine phosgene and diphosgene phosgene types having little colour or smell harassing gases were non lethal and included tear gas to compel opponents to wear their gas masks catching troops not wearing gas masks with a lethal concentration of gas was difficult but phosgene bombardments could cause casualties slow completion of tasks and tire victims canadians collected 4 5 inch and 60 pounder gas shells for operation before attack royal engineers bombarded german defences with of gas fired from livens projectors two prisoners of infantry regiment 156 said that their companies of eighty men and 56 men had suffered twenty and 29 gas casualties a prisoner from infantry regiment 22 said that two companies had suffered 90 gas casualties machine guns thumb alt vickers machine gun in battle of passchendaele september 1917 sixteen companies from canadian machine gun corps with 128 vickers machine guns and armoured cars of canadian motor machine gun brigade cmmgb with 32 guns under command of divisions were to supplement artillery by firing a barrage over heads of canadian infantry harassing machine gun fire was to impede movement of german troops and supplies with targets engaged by at least four guns vickers guns were supplied with 20 000 bullets per gun per day to fire day and night to make it more difficult for german troops to repair their defences and put out more barbed wire cars of cmmgb drove back and forth behind canadian lines and from mid july to early august fired including static guns about ten million rounds were fired before canadian attack when hill was captured guns were to be dug in one for every of front guarded but several infantry sections royal flying corps canadian corps had 16 squadron 40 squadron nieuport 17s and 43 squadron sopwith 1 1 2 strutters rfc in support and sopwith camels of 8 naval squadron royal naval air service for high patrols over battlefield an advanced landing ground at petit sains was made ready for 43 squadron strutters to mount continuous counter attack reconnaissance patrols formations of three strutters were to observe an area wide and deep that counter attacking german troops would have to traverse strutter crews were to report their observations by wireless to canadian corps and heavy artillery group headquarters then attack with their machine guns any german artillery or concentrations of troops seen at bottlenecks contact patrols to mark progress of canadian infantry were to be flown by b e 2c crews of 16 squadron on 9 august six 40 squadron nieuport 17s made a low level attack on six german observation balloons along hill 70 lens front and shot them down german artillery observation was obstructed but attack made canadian interest in area obvious for two days and nights before attack 10 squadron 25 squadron dh 4 and 27 squadron martinsyde elephant bombed railway junctions airfields and billets in earlier battles british fighters patrolling at height to engage german fighters had not been able to see low flying camouflaged german aircraft which flew artillery observation and ground attack sorties without interference six nieuport 17s of 40 squadron moved to an advanced landing ground at mazingarbe about behind front and a ground station was established on heights west of loos when observers spotted a german aircraft at low altitude a wireless message was sent to mazingarbe for a nieuport 17 to be sent up to engage german aircraft a letter code on white canvas sheets containing location of german aircraft could be laid on ground for an airborne fighter pilot to read deception operations thumb by 16 july canadian corps had redeployed for attack on hill 70 1st canadian division had taken over from i corps to north west of hill and canadian corps occupied a line from souchez river northwards to just beyond hill 70 to deceive germans about place and size of attack and to disguise canadian preparations xiii canadian i and xi corps began to conduct larger raids in battalion strength on most nights from middle of july along with gas discharges along front towards end of month raids and bombardments on army front increased xi corps to north raided nightly i corps conducted destructive and wire cutting bombardments at night and bombarded german front with machine guns and mortars during day xiii corps conducted similar operations on right southern army flank in late july 9th canadian brigade feinted a direct attack of lens by engaging units of german 36th reserve division at mericourt trench bad weather led to attack on hill 70 being postponed from late july until mid august in interim special companies of royal engineers augmented regular level of bombardment by firing drums from livens projectors and shells into lens by 15 august artillery neutralized of an estimated batteries in area by zero hour partly using technique of predicted fire using datum points and calibrated guns for first time which greatly improved accuracy of artillery troops were rotated through reserve area to conduct training and rehearsals in preparation for assault on northern left flank 46th north midland division made a diversionary attack north of hill with poison gas discharges artillery bombardments and preparation of dummy tanks and troops on two nights before attack to be exposed to view at zero hour battle 15 august thumb left upright during night of canadian infantry assembled in their jumping off points harassing fire from german artillery continued but with no particular intensity germans had moved up reserves on previous night in anticipation of an attack and main assembly of canadian troops was detected by at canadian creeping barrage began and infantry advanced some troops having left their trenches early to avoid german counter barrage expected as soon as attack began at special companies re fired of oil from livens projectors which dropped into german defences in cite st elisabeth creating a smoke screen and began an hour long smoke bombardment from 4 inch stokes mortars artillery forward observation officers moved forward with infantry and artillery observation aircraft flew overhead sending for artillery fire by wireless that day in 1st canadian division area 4 special company re fired mortars and livens projectors against left flank of attack as a deception and to shield attack front from observers on higher ground several miles to north on right southern flank in 4th canadian division area a special company used livens projectors to fire cylinders into german positions around avion after four minutes creeping barrage began to move in increments keeping about 25 percent of ground to be crossed under bombardment vickers gunners fired a machine gun barrage at maximum range then gradually fired shorter towards german positions canadian infantry reached blue line forward in twenty minutes and paused to dig in advance began again and reached final objective red line at german resistance was determined and canadians used lewis guns to pin down german infantry as rifle and bombing sections attacked from a flank on southern right flank 4th canadian division diversion succeeded and with fewer guns in support german artillery reply was more effective than further north 12th canadian infantry brigade anticipated german artillery bombardment and canadians took cover in deep shelters in edge of lens brigade suffering fewer than 24 casualties during first day four attacking canadian brigades began to consolidate as soon as they reached their objectives and each brigade emplaced 48 vickers guns in its section of blue line connexions to artillery were established by observers with field telephones wireless and signal lamps and artillery changed from bombardment and creeping barrage fire to be ready to fire sos barrages against german counter attacks at about 4th guard division began first german attack having been seen assembling in cite st auguste germans had to move over about of open ground and canadian gun machine gun and rifle fire covered ground with corpses and wounded an attack at met same fate few germans reaching canadians being bombed out german counter attacks continued and german artillery still in action tried to support attacks and shell canadian defences a counter attack at was prepared by german heavy artillery which cut many of field telephone links to canadian artillery but some remained operational and several runners got through with messages 2nd canadian division artillery received message please turn artillery on and did repulsing attack canadian gunners did same to another german attempt at canadian machine gunners fired all day seven guns of 3rd canadian machine gun company firing in a few minutes air operations sopwith of 43 squadron received many hits from ground fire but only two were shot down three crew being wounded a german aircraft was shot down and others driven off but four more were too badly damaged to be serviceable for 16 august one sopwith attacked troops in drocourt trench another aircraft attacked a transport column near then troops near and in about infantry behind north of lens were strafed then information was reported from mazingarbe to canadian corps heavy artillery which dispersed german troops while flying artillery observation sorties in afternoon 16 squadron aircrew saw four waves of german infantry advancing in open to counter attack crews called on canadian heavy artillery and then attacked with their machine guns which all but annihilated german force from 15 to 17 august rfc sent of german artillery in action and all were answered by counter battery groups counter attacks to prepare for german counter attacks 1st and 2nd canadian divisions began to reverse captured trenches and construct strong points immediately after capturing blue line within two hours of start of battle germans began using their immediate reserves to mount local counter attacks between on morning of 15 august germans executed four local attacks against canadian positions each attack was repulsed due in large part to work of forward artillery observers who could now overlook some of german positions on one occasion a german counter attack was only repulsed after engaging in hand to hand fighting germans rapidly brought up seven additional battalions from 4th guards division and 185th division to reinforce eight line battalions over following three days germans counter attacked 21 times against canadian positions a frontal attack against 2nd canadian infantry brigade on afternoon of 15 august ultimately failed a german attack against 4th canadian infantry brigade re captured chicory trench but german infantry were expelled later that afternoon 16 17 august thumb right morning of 16 august was relatively quiet with only a few attempts made by small german parties to approach canadian lines after having failed to capture all their objectives previous day and after several postponements 2nd canadian infantry brigade relieved two attacking battalions with 5th and 10th canadian battalions which attacked by short dashes for down bare slope and captured remainder of final objective attack was costly as germans opposite were preparing their own counter attack and hand to hand fighting took place at chalk quarry which cost germans 100 fatal casualties 100 wounded and thirty prisoners germans began to counter attack at after a delay but good observation enabled attacks to be repulsed by massed artillery fire machine gun fire and fire of canadian infantry to south 5th canadian battalion retired about from final objective to shell holes after suffering many casualties and running short of ammunition brigade suffered killed wounded and missing attempts by 4th and 11th canadian infantry brigades to eliminate a german salient between cite st elisabeth and lens on 17 august failed and as had been foreseen germans continued to mount determined counter attacks german commanders realized that canadian and british artillery would need to be neutralized before a counter attack could succeed germans began a series of counter attacks against a chalk quarry under canadian control outside cite st auguste and tried to mislead canadian artillery by sending up false flare signals or provoking infantry to call for unnecessary artillery fire germans stopped wave attacks and counter attacked with dispersed groups of troops trickling forward using cover some managed to reach canadian defences and fight hand to hand germans began to use poison gas in earnest and from 15 000 to 20 000 of new yellow cross shells containing blistering agent sulphur mustard were fired in addition to green cross diphosgene shells positions of 1st and 2nd canadian artillery field brigades and canadian front line were gassed 1st canadian division artillery suffered 183 casualties and three batteries suffered direct hits many gunners became casualties after gas fogged goggles of their respirators and they were forced to remove them to set fuses lay their sights and maintain accurate fire 17 18 august on night of german troops made several attempts to recapture chalk quarry and chicory trench under cover of gas all attempts against chalk quarry failed and only one company of reserve infantry regiment 55 on loan to 11th reserve division managed to breach canadian defences at chicory trench before being repulsed german troops employing flamethrowers managed to penetrate canadian line north of quarry on morning of 18 august before being driven out 19 20 august thumb front quietened significantly after final counter attack against chalk quarry for canadian corps following two days consisted largely of consolidation front line was drawn back midway between original intermediate and final objectives 4th canadian division slightly advanced its forward posts on outskirts of lens and extended its front northward to include lens bethune road currie wished to further improve position around hill 70 and ordered an attack against german positions along a front opposite 2nd and 4th canadian divisions 21 22 august attack on lens operation was scheduled for morning of 21 august tasks being divided between 6th canadian infantry brigade on left and 10th canadian infantry brigade on right attack was to begin at but germans began shelling canadian positions at just before canadian attack left flank of 6th canadian infantry brigade was attacked by units of 4th guard division and a battalion of 220th division forces met between their objectives and fought hand to hand and with bayonet in melee 6th canadian infantry brigade advance was stopped and troops forced back to their start line communication between forward units and brigade headquarters had broken down at beginning of attack and could not be restored due to german bombardment making it all but impossible to co ordinate infantry and artillery on right flank a unit of 10th canadian infantry brigade suffered a large number of casualties to german artillery while assembling for attack and was met with massed artillery and machine gun fire near its objective only three small parties largest of not more than twenty men reached their goal other two attacking units captured their objectives late in evening creating a salient in 4th canadian division line on evening of 21 august three parties went forward to bomb german position from flanks but were only moderately successful and an attack on 22 august failed to materialize due to battalion level misunderstandings a brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy situation by attacking green slag heap and mine complex at fosse st louis attack was repulsed most of attackers being killed wounded or taken prisoner germans held on to area until beginning of final german retreat in 1918 aftermath analysis thumb upright on 15 august haig made a diary note that attack had gone very well horne called it an unqualified success despite failure of 6th army to retreat and began to plan an attack on sallaumines hill for early september in 1942 writers of german official history volume xiii wrote that since mid july german defences at lens and for about to north had been under bombardment which became more intense in august because haig wanted a diversion from offensive in flanders on 15 august canadian corps attacked german positions from lens to about north took an important height hill 70 for observation and pushed beyond first position counter attacks recaptured pockets of ground but canadians could not be expelled from fighting continued intermittently until 24 august but did not lead to more significant changes canadians took over and in their counter attacks germans over prisoners in 1981 sydney wise author of royal canadian air force official history called attack at hill 70 a demonstration of how a set piece attack should be carried out germans refrained from attempts to recapture lost ground at lens due to need to avoid diverting resources from third battle of ypres in flanders main strategic effort on western front by both sides in 2009 tim cook wrote that canadian attack had crushed defenders by 18 august 21 german counter attacks being repulsed canadian plan had succeeded but had depended on determination of canadian infantry against equally determined opponents who suffered approximately against attack ended on 25 august and was a considerable victory despite germans retaining their hold on occupation of lens two german divisions intended for flanders had been diverted to hill 70 and reinforcement plan for fighting at ypres had been dislocated cook called battle most one sided german defeat apart from battle of messines in june attacks into lens had been clumsy hurried affairs and that canadians suffered nearly from 21 to 25 august frontal attacks on 21 and 23 august were rash and demonstrated that currie lacked experience cook placed blame on watson and hilliam latter of whom should have been sacked in 2016 robert foley wrote that army group crown prince rupprecht and 6th army headquarters thought that canadian advance had been stopped by 16 august below wrote in his diary that more than ten attacks by canadians best english sic troops had been repulsed canadian attack had been stopped because english lacked flexibility to exploit success a criticism that had emerged during battle of somme in 1916 canadian attack was seen as a feint to divert german divisions from flanders and army group ordered 6th army to fight with its own resources including seven divisions in army reserve 4th guard and 220th divisions acted as on 15 august and with existing divisions conducted most of german defence once german counter attack in 15 august had failed attempt to recapture hill 70 was abandoned and counter attacks were restricted local efforts to repulse canadian attacks and for tactical improvements to german defences two divisions were moved from reserve to replace 4th guard and 220th divisions three more divisions in reserve remaining available to 6th army no forces were transferred to lens from flanders or anywhere else and no divisions were sent to flanders from 15 to 25 august foley wrote that 1st guard reserve division had been included in some accounts but that neither below or other german sources from time refer to it foley also wrote that canadian sources mention 185th division in interrogation reports in 2017 andrew rawson wrote that canadian attack prevented germans from transferring five divisions in lens area to flanders casualties around 22 august first army intelligence department estimated that germans had suffered casualties in history of great war 1948 british official historian james edmonds wrote that from 15 to 23 august 1st canadian division suffered second canadian division suffered being killed and 4th canadian division had including corps troops and other troops attached to 1st canadian division suffered a total of troops were taken prisoner in canadian official history 1962 g w l nicholson wrote that canadians and attached troops suffered in surviving trench warfare 1992 bill rawling wrote that attack on hill 70 cost canadian corps and prisoner in subsequent attacks into lens canadian corps suffered another increasing number to in eleven days in 2009 tim cook wrote that canadians suffered during preparations for attack in first two weeks of august and from 15 to 25 august hill 70 and another on western front canadians had suffered nearly their casualties from 21 to 25 august in capturing hill 70 2016 eds douglas delaney and serge durflinger delaney wrote that tim cook had remedied a mistake in canadian official history which gave canadian corps casualties for august rather than for period 15 to 25 august in 2016 robert foley wrote that german casualties were difficult
