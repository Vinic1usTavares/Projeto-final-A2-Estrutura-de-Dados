federalists in general assembly nominated marshall for united states senate harrison and klotter p 75 on first ballot marshall garnered 18 votes compared with 16 for democratic republican john

temporary national capital george muter and benjamin sebastian both justices of kentucky court of appeals published a pamphlet stating that marshall had perjured himself in a court of appeals case between himself and james wilkinson quisenberry p 63 no known copies of pamphlet are extant and related surviving documents do not relate exact nature of charges marshall being out of state was unable to reply immediately to charges and his enemies in general assembly drafted a memorial to u s senate requesting an investigation of charges on december 16 1795 memorial was approved by general assembly and transmitted to senate quisenberry p 66 senate appointed a committee to recommend action on memorial and committee found that charges against marshall were not specific that authors had provided no evidence upon which to evaluate charges that no one was empowered to prosecute charges in senate and that further action by senate was inappropriate quisenberry pp 68 70 on march 22 1796 senate approved committee s report by a vote of 16 8 quisenberry p 68 muter and sebastian never filed formal charges against marshall for perjury quisenberry p 70 although marshall was not frequently

gives his experience if you are determined to proceed let exercise be performed in decent order let me give my experience first thought of hearing a religious testimony from marshall a noted atheist so humored mob that it disbanded in a fit of laughter and marshall escaped in subsequent senatorial election however breckinridge defeated marshall for his seat later political career after expiration of his senate term in 1801 marshall returned to his farm and his law practice seldom acting in realm of public affairs quisenberry p 71 in 1806 however he resumed his attacks on suspected participants in spanish conspiracy his articles in newly founded frankfort western world newspaper written under pseudonym observer prompted kentucky house of representatives to form a select committee to investigate his charges committee found that benjamin sebastian had received a pension of 2 000 a year from spain in return for his involvement in conspiracy harrison and klotter p 74 federal judge harry innes a frequent object of marshall s suspicions testified against sebastian before committee sebastian resigned his position on court and house declined to pursue further action against him marshall also unsuccessfully lobbied through his brother in law u s attorney joseph hamilton daveiss for a grand jury to indict aaron burr for attempting to enlist kentuckians to participate in burr conspiracy marshall s intensified attacks on judge harry innes in pages of western world became so severe that they prompted innes to sue both marshall and western world co founder joseph m street for libel quisenberry p 78 both cases dragged on for several years in courts buoyed by his involvement in exposure of benjamin sebastian marshall declared his candidacy for a seat in kentucky house in 1807 quisenberry p 97 friends of innes and others implicated by marshall in spanish conspiracy recruited nathaniel richardson a lawyer turned farmer to oppose marshall approximately 1 100 votes were

reelection in 1808 and defeated his opponent john m scott by a majority of 11 votes identical to his margin previous year quisenberry p 90 expectations of a confrontation between marshall and fellow representative henry clay were high during session owing to tensions between two dating back to clay s defense of aaron burr during burr conspiracy quisenberry p 100 george d prentice in his biography of clay records that some of clay s allies in house refused to vote for him for speaker of house so that clay would remain on chamber floor from whence he was better able to counter marshall clay s chair in chamber was separated from marshall s only by that of general christopher riffe representative from lincoln county who was described as a burly german of almost gigantic size and herculean strength a few minor quarrels passed between marshall and clay early in session but relative peace dissolved in december 1808 when clay introduced a resolution calling for all members of general assembly to wear homespun garments as a means of encouraging local manufacturing and reducing british imports harrison and klotter p 90 although clay typically wore finer garments than marshall for duration of debate on his motion clay wore simple homemade clothes marshall regarded measure as demagoguery and employed a tailor to make him a suit of british broadcloth to wear on house floor two men exchanged insults on house floor and would have commenced a physical altercation if not for riffe s intervention instead on january 4 1809 clay challenged marshall to a duel which he quickly accepted quisenberry p 101 duel took place in indiana on january 19 1809 just across ohio river from shippingport kentucky joseph hamilton daveiss provided pistols quisenberry p 103 on first shot marshall missed and clay lightly grazed marshall s stomach marshall missed again on second shot and clay s pistol misfired marshall s third shot lightly wounded clay in thigh while clay missed marshall entirely clay insisted that two each take another shot but marshall declined on grounds that clay s injury put him on unequal footing with his adversary and matter was ended expulsion from and reelection to house tensions between marshall and innes continued during marshall s tenure in legislature when innes acting on a recommendation from an advisory jury dismissed an unrelated fraud case brought by marshall in innes district court marshall retaliated by convincing congressman john rowan to file an impeachment petition against innes in house of representatives innes countered by having his son in law thomas bodley pursue a censure of marshall in state house rowan s petition against innes failed but bodley s against marshall succeeded and marshall was expelled from house in 1808 only to be re elected following year marshall sought reelection in 1810 but was defeated by george adams by a margin of 76 votes quisenberry p 111 from 1812 to 1813 he served on board of trustees

marshall was called to one final act of public service upon death of martin d hardin who had been elected to kentucky house of representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office marshall pursued an abbreviated campaign for vacant seat and defeated dudley by a margin of 3 votes primary issue of day was old court new court controversy an attempt by legislature to abolish extant court of appeals and replace it with a new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for old court which was prevailing sentiment in his district his actions in session however appear to have been unremarkable and he did not seek reelection at end of his term later life

political career marshall became more interested in writing he frequently contributed content to state s newspapers and occasionally wrote poetry he founded american republic only federalist newspaper

court until 1811 quisenberry p 79 jury found in innes favor and awarded 750 in damages although innes counsel henry clay and robert wickliffe insisted that innes only desired vindication of a guilty verdict against street and would not collect damages soon after street shuttered western world and moved to illinois as libel suit against marshall dragged on in mercer county circuit court innes and his allies hired author william littell to publish innes version of his interactions with spain marshall countered by publishing his history of kentucky in 1812 although blatantly partisan it became

agreement stipulated that neither man would write or publish anything that was disrespectful of other innes upheld his part of agreement but in 1824 eight years after innes death marshall published an
