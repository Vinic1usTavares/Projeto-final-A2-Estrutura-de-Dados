theory which considered events of series to be hallucinations or dreams character of dave was written as both a side of hurley who denied his problems and an analogue to hurley s disappeared father and his scenes were filmed so that his reveal as imaginary would be a plot twist plot flashback hurley jorge garcia is in a mental institution where he is friends with dave evan handler who tells

he talks later locke terry o quinn confronts prisoner demanding to know if he let himself be caught thinking it might have been to find swan henry however calls hatch a joke saying that during lockdown he never entered numbers into computer or pushed button he simply stood there and watched timer s numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own locke however replies angrily that henry is lying but he replies that he s done lying production thumb right evan handler played dave in this episode alt a bald man wearing a white shirt and a black jacket abc was concerned about content of episode arguing that idea that story could be all in hurley s head was offering an explanation for show as a whole since a recurring theory among fandom was that events of series were hallucinations character of dave was meant to be a side of hurley who felt he had no problem and encourages hurley to overeat and is played by evan handler in a way director jack bender described as mischievous impish like showrunner carlton cuse revealed his name comes from hurley s father david reyes who would later appear in series played by cheech marin because writers wanted hurley to imagine a friend and have that be wrapped up in his unresolved relationship with his dad final scene with libby was so secret that only jack bender and his assistant director had it in their scripts and to prevent libby from being only woman in mental institution every woman on set including bender s daughter sophie was dressed in robes and pajamas to appear as background characters director bender decided to depict dave in a way audiences would first believe him to be real but without character actually interacting with physical world similar to films such as sixth sense and a beautiful mind for scene in which dave walks through jungle with hurley red and orange flowers were placed to add some magic to scene something bender described as a hurley in wonderland feel scene in which hurley attacks sawyer was intended to be a humorous moment with bender suggesting that tent be knocked over and josh holloway adding sawyer trying to escape but being pulled back scene in which dave starts listing to hurley why island events are occurring in his mind suffered from continuous interruption as military exercises on joint base pearl harbor hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises weather problems also plagued production with loud waves causing hurley s and libby s beach scene to be redubbed in post production and rain on one day changing location of basketball game scene to an indoor court and also leading to a second day of filming on cliff cliff was digitally redesigned in post production to appear as if actors were standing on edge dave s jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen with body hitting water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics mental hospital was shot at laniakea ywca in honolulu except for dr brooks s office which was done inside a studio reception 16 38 million american viewers tuned into this episode reviews were mixed scott brown of entertainment weekly praised jorge garcia s and michael emerson s performances and said that episode made island feel dangerous again ryan j budke of tv squad felt that b story in hatch was more interesting than hurley s scenes and considered dave depressing in opposition to other so light hearted hurley centered episodes ign s chris carabott gave episode a 7 out of 10 considering it entertaining even if it doesn t really impact series as a whole but website later ranked dave as 9th worst lost episode ever describing it as meaningless and saying flashback felt pretty extraneous new york magazine listed dave sixth in a twenty most pointless episodes of lost list considering that using an episode to disprove a theory that wasn t so prevalent was a waste of time on other hand los angeles times ranked episode as 30th best of series describing it as perhaps most misunderstood episode of lost ever saying that dave not being real was meant to be a twist but just biggest expression of just how messed up hurley was before he
