run by hamster corporation rom image for game had been copied from board in cabinet at nintendo of america because it is only known unmodified boardset according to nintendo world report rerelease may have taken years to come to fruition because of legal issues with ikegami tsushinki reception reviewing switch release both nintendo world report and nintendo life said game was enjoyable when playing for a high score but it lacked variety nintendo life enjoyed striking a balance between completing levels quickly and plotting a route to maximise your point scoring nintendo world report did not like how game repeated same few stages and felt as though game was not finished they also panned stage graphics calling them extremely crude compared to donkey kong nintendo life agreed in that colors were garish in places and environments were blocky writing this simple design and plain backgrounds ensure everything is easy to follow but sky skipper certainly shows its age both praised extra options included with arcade archives release having played vintage arcade nintendo of america s gameplay tester howard philips called sky skipper a confusing thematic mess akin to an lsd trip atari hq found vintage atari 2600 port to be average with simple gameplay and unremarkable graphics and sound preservation efforts in early 2000s developer factor 5 founder julian eggebrecht made a deal with nintendo that if he was able to ship star wars rogue squadron ii rogue leader 2001 on schedule he could borrow their sky skipper cabinet for his company s arcade factor 5 shipped rogue leader on time and so received machine upon booting it up they realized one of rom chips was dead they reached out to genyo takeda who pulled original files from nintendo s archives enabling eggebrecht to repair machine in 2016 a group of arcade restoration enthusiasts started a project to build a restored sky skipper cabinet no complete cabinets were known to exist in private collections there were only four boards owned by collectors which although loaded with popeye rom images were known to have been converted from sky skipper based on their serial numbers sky skipper rom images had been distributed online in past so team was able to boards and reload them with sky skipper rom images they still needed information on design and colors of cabinet so they contacted video game player billy mitchell to connect with nintendo of america to their surprise nintendo explained that they still had a sky skipper cabinet and granted them access to examine it they spent several hours on site scanning and photographing cabinet with scans they took and sourcing one of four known boards they were able to create a faithful recreation of cabinet in nintendo of america s archives notes references external
