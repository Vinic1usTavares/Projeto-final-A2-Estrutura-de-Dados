that of dark humor employed by detectives as a coping mechanism for dealing with horrors of job williams previously worked with homicide executive producer barry levinson on films good morning vietnam

children but ellison stops him protesting that experience is too hard on them after obtaining information from street thugs police arrest marvin antonio charity who possesses 45 caliber bullets matching those used in shooting marvin tells detectives that he s a stone stick up man who has robbed dozens of people and never shot anyone because people don t argue with a 45 carrying man and also that he knows he will spend decades in prison anyway because he was involved in shooting so there is no reason he would lie about being shooter a mournful ellison overhears felton making jokes about investigation and bragging about overtime he expects to receive from it he angrily demands felton be thrown off case but gee yaphet kotto calms him down by explaining police have to be detached from victims because they encounter so many ellison takes his children back to their hotel room where his daughter abby julia devin is in denial about her mother s death and his son matt jake gyllenhaal

tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison but ellison tells howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead howard tries to give vaughn s letter to ellison but he refuses to accept it howard eventually speaks directly to vaughn in prison where vaughn admits he handled gun during stick up because he thought if he had gun he could control situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt vaughn said he lost control of robbery and insists he needs to serve life sentence to make amends a devastated howard finally agrees with felton s opinion that vaughn was indeed shooter production despite critical acclaim homicide life on street suffered from poor ratings throughout its first season prompting nbc to consider taking it off air after a nine episode first season network approved four more episodes for show s second season as a trial run to determine whether to continue or cancel show script for bop gun was completed before first season ended but nbc executives asked for several refinements including less involved plots and fewer camera movements before approving a second season in an attempt to appease network and improve ratings executive producers barry levinson and tom fontana sought to make subtle changes to give show a stronger mainstream appeal while aiming not to compromise its integrity or originality with bop gun producers slightly toned down bleak visual style and hand held photography motif it is also first episode to focus on a single story rather than multiple subplots which fontana felt allowed writers to tell main story better fontana said of changes to series we were experimenting with our first nine episodes whenever you try something new you tend to err on side of breaking ground but we d rather have more people watching so colors and lighting are slightly brighter and camera movements are not as jarring bop gun marked first episode with jean de segonzac as director of photography first scene which depicts moments immediately before shooting juxtaposes shots of ellison family admiring tourist attractions of baltimore with shots of their shooters playing basketball before following family photography depicts different sides of baltimore by presenting ellison family shots like a cheerful tourist advertisement with other shots presenting a grittier image of city thumb 180 px right david simon pictured wrote bop gun along with screenwriter david mills bop gun marked first episode in its new time slot on thursdays at 10 p m occupying a period previously filled by l a law show previously aired 9 p m on

gyllenhaal a feature director then best known for such films as waterland 1992 and a dangerous woman 1993 it was first television script written by mills who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with simon while studying journalism at university of maryland college park mills said of bop gun that script inspired me to quit journalism it was a golden opportunity even though i didn t know what i was doing i developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer i would always stretch a project to fill available time bop gun served as a departure from previous homicide life on street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim rather than on detectives simon felt script s dialogue particularly detectives use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with horrors of homicide unit were faithful to reality he particularly cited scene in which felton angers ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get simon said that s a conversation that would happen it would happen in any homicide unit in america and when i saw it actually being acted out i got a real kick in pants because i thought wherever there are homicide detectives watching this they re cracking up because they know how true it is bop gun was originally meant to serve as second season finale but nbc decided to make it season premiere with hopes of getting increased ratings from a guest appearance by robin williams williams portrayed robert ellison husband of a slain woman tourist several news sources indicated williams took on role as a favor to homicide executive producer barry levinson who directed williams in films good morning vietnam 1987 and toys 1992 but fontana said williams agreed to take part based on actor s positive impression of both show in general and bop gun script in particular fontana said of williams he read script responded instantly and said when do you want me there he could not have been more prepared or more of a gentleman to everyone and he worked his tail off that whole experience was a joy williams himself said of show visually it was just so different from anything else on television although williams was primarily known for his comedic work homicide producers and williams himself consciously decided to remain true to original script rejecting idea of adding humor or jokes to episode williams scenes were filmed over three days and actors found part emotionally draining kalat p 128 fontana said williams worked like a dog it was quite a special event for all of us it s very intense a 13 year old jake gyllenhaal son of episode s director stephen made one of his earliest acting performances in bop gun as matt young son of robert ellison williams and homicide regular richard belzer were acquainted from a hbo comedy special they both appeared in although two had never acted together before two often joked between filming takes except for during williams most dramatic scenes episode also featured

television series if we can keep a reasonable level of audience we believe in work we believe in creative team we think we have perhaps most outstanding ensemble cast in all of television we just would like to see continued signs of life reviews bop gun received generally positive reviews and was identified by baltimore sun as one of ten best episodes of series sun writer david zurawik said gyllenhaal s direction was as good as anything he had done in film and called script one of most ambitious scripts you ll see on tv this year lon grahnke of chicago sun times gave episode his highest rating of four stars and called williams portrayal a piercing dramatic performance grahnke also said in one hour bop gun says more about firearms urban tragedies crime victims and racial politics than any congressman trying to blame television for our violent society entertainment weekly critic ken tucker complimented episode noting don t let williams distract you from real stuff here brilliantly jagged murder investigation scenes and exceptional performances from homicide detective costars daniel baldwin and melissa leo tribune company television critic kate o hare praised bop gun for focusing on characterization and dialogue rather than action and said of episode with a mix of intense emotion dogged police work and humorous banter among detectives bop gun typifies philosophy of homicide david p kalat author of homicide life on street unofficial companion called it a grueling episode and that williams performed probably his finest performance ever kalat p 132 philadelphia inquirer television critic jonathan storm lauded cast visual art of camera and realistic yet nearly literary dialogue of bop gun times picayune writer benjamin morrison praised unexpectedly understated performance of williams and praised episode for not being simple or formulaic he suggested viewers who were crime victims themselves would be particularly moved by script hal boedeker television critic with miami herald called episode an uncompromising hour and highest order for network tv he said williams in every scene and praised script for not racing over topics as many television shows do but rather taking full measure of weight of grief elaine liner television critic with corpus christi caller times described williams performance as heartbreaking but particularly praised writers for taking show to a higher level by making perpetrator sympathetic and three dimensional not only victim liner said fontana succeeds in fleshing out characters on both sides of this tragedy bob langford of news observer called episode brilliant and praised it for focusing not on crime but on effects of it as well as realistic portrayals regarding race such as concerns crime would keep away white tourists langford said it was occasionally preachy but said sometimes a good sermon is what we need amazing that one this powerful can come from a tv show adam sandler of daily variety praised cast hysteria and confusion conveyed in gyllenhaal s direction and themes of police insensitivity victims rights and dysfunctional families in script washington post writer harriet winslow called williams performance poignant and riveting and called fact that it did not overshadow other actors a tribute to quality of this cast john j o connor of new york times called episode extraordinary and said senselessness of incident is heartbreakingly captured st louis post dispatch writer gail pennington praised williams controlled performance as well as several terrific scenes among them she said were gee s explanation of how police use humor as a buffer from horrors of their jobs and scene where detectives simultaneously interrogate two suspects in different rooms which she said was choreographed as tightly as bolshoi ballet not all reviews were so positive dallas morning news writer ed bark called williams a sometimes overly transparent effort to underscore grief of victims survivors and said episode works overtime to make world seem like a bleak and scary place bark also said show made itself a target for charges of racism by making three murderers black but also credited script with making one of perpetrators so sympathetic tom shales of washington post said writers try a little too hard to create sympathy for three murder suspects and episode suffers due to absence of actor andre braugher who plays detective frank pembleton but shales also praised williams performance and said episode was particularly powerful because actual violence is off screen buzz mccain columnist with washington times called episode irritating and as pointless as killing he particularly criticized script which he said was cliched and overly misty eyed particularly extended moments of williams talking about shooting in a later article mccain said nothing i ve written in this column generated as much visceral response as my nine paragraphs about bop gun in addition to responses from angry fans mccain received a call from david mills who mccain said simply wanted some insight as to what specifically i didn t like about his show and how writers might
