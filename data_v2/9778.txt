war tour was a concert tour by irish rock band u2 which took place in 1982 and 1983 in support of group s third album war exact delineation of this tour is subject to various interpretations u2 s website labels pre war tour as separate from war tour and specifies only two legs for war tour with second leg containing american dates european festivals and japan dates despite large geographical and chronological gaps between them tour chronicler pimm jal de la parra also considers pre war tour and war tour as separate and specifies two legs for war tour but considers second leg to have ended with american dates with european festivals and japan dates are outside tour per se long running website u2tours com has same definitions as u2 website website u2gigs com groups 1982 dates within war tour as a war pre tour leg and assigns european festivals and japan dates each their own leg for an overall total of five legs website com is similar website u2setlists com follows same practice with regard to pre war tour but european festivals and japan dates to be legless parts of overall tour there is no official definition of concert tours and their legs especially in early stages of artists careers when touring takes place on a nearly constant basis for sake of convenience everything that could be considered part of war tour is discussed in this article tour took place in western europe united states canada and japan with new material from war taking an increasing role as tour progressed venues were mostly halls but some arenas were introduced later on u2 s performances were very well received both critically and commercially especially in united states where u2 broke through to become a major act scenes of lead singer bono waving a white flag during song sunday bloody sunday became an emblematic image of this phase of u2 s career it was their first tour as full time headlining act and their first to be profitable live album under a blood red sky and concert film u2 live at red rocks under a blood red sky both originated from performances on tour latter matched u2 s concert fervour with spectacular natural setting of red rocks amphitheatre in rain to produce a memorable document of war tour and to further increase group s popularity u2 s filming of red rocks show was later selected by rolling stone magazine as one of 50 moments that changed history of rock and roll itinerary after war had been recorded but three months before it was released u2 began playing pre war tour de la parra 2003 pp 35 37 20 shows and a television appearance in halls in western

at red rocks amphitheatre an outdoor venue near morrison colorado in foothills of rocky mountains that many travelling musicians consider most spectacular outdoor venue in united states was recorded for what turned out to be a live album entitled under a blood red sky and concert film entitled live at red rocks under a blood red sky a steady rain and surreal torch lit natural beauty of surroundings combined to present u2 s performance in most dramatic of contexts frequently shown on mtv video helped to further expand band s american audience and rewarded large financial risk show

made two television appearances one of which featured a performance of new year s day in which edge performed almost entirely on piano due to a guitar failure shows and reception in both uk and us publicity for tour group emphasised that it opposed wallpaper music from artists who spent more time on their hairdos than anything else de la parra 2003 pp 38 41 in us advertisements for tour read u2 declare war and talked about war on boring music especially in context of breaking up conservative radio formats national identification also played a role bono said to us audiences variants of we re not just another english fashion band passing through we re an irish band and we re here to stay jeff u2 peace with honor village voice 1983 05 24 in bordowitz ed u2 reader pp 189 191 wars music its music videos and war tour separated u2 from mass of new wave or college rock acts and into mainstream rock visibility shows were typically 90 minutes long bono was emotional and very theatrical during shows during songs he would climb lighting rigs plunge into audience or walk out onto side balconies as tour progressed band members and others became concerned that bono s antics while making for good press copy and having an electric effect on some fans were detracting from music and might end in a disaster an assessment bono later agreed with new year s day became a hit single and in concert performances full of vitality edge would rapidly switch back and forth between piano and electric guitar older songs such as gloria and 11 o clock tick tock were kept in set list 40 s show closing thoughtful presence wherein edge and bassist adam clayton swapped instruments then three band members left one by one leaving only drummer larry mullen jr grew into an audience participation ritual that would continue even after band had left stage at one show at dublin s phoenix park racecourse fans singing of refrain how long to sing this song from song went on for 15 minutes after concert s end de la parra 2003 p 50 initial british critical reaction to first leg of war tour was favourable but with some reservations group was already well known there and while war debuted at top of uk albums chart it had encountered some early backlash with nme saying great personal fury of u2 s early work had been replaced by literal but sincere sloganeering sounds magazine said a birmingham show had pacing and thematic problems due to newer numbers clumsily breaking mood that had earlier been created but praised many other elements of show saying that their skill at breaking down barriers between band and audience has never been better some poor notices for album itself from british pop weeklies upset bono during tour and one from sounds bothered him so much that insulted reviewer by name during a show in portsmouth jobling 2014 pp 102 103 u2 s exciting concerts earned critical praise during american leg where band had not been as well known previously both american audiences and american critics were more open than british to group s upfront emotional statements and theatricality jobling 2014 pp 103 104 new york times john rockwell wrote that this is a great live band bono is a riveting public personality leaping and crawling all over stage and above it into scaffolding boston globe wrote that group s performance reached a rare wondrous zone where rock n roll transcended ordinary and took audience on a lift that was equal parts spiritual and sensual it said that bono s vocals sound like pleas and prayers lyrics failure and hope and described edge s guitar playing as embodying clear ringing lines that were both atmospheric and jarring oregonian wrote that it was best concert of 1983 so far solid music played rhythmically and well a positive stage attitude that recognised audience input excellent sound and lights village voice wrote that u2 in concert evoked an undeniable righteousness about which u2 was thrilled and their audience was thrilled journalist rick miller wrote of opening us show in chapel hill there are no words for warmth of thrill that u2 gave crowd i surrendered and i know i m not alone contemporary christian music magazine said that show avoided typical juvenile stage patter cliches and that from a christian perspective it is true that u2 doesn t preach but that does not mean a message is not communicated tickets were in demand in us spurred by word of mouth and breakthrough of new year s day as a hit single there many of war tour shows sold out on american leg group began booking bigger venues on tour as a result tour helped war stay in or near us albums chart top 20 for duration of that leg which represented by far their best commercial performance so far in united states de la parra 2003 p 41 at same time band had to deal with larger scale success for first time with more of a distance between themselves and their audience and with audience itself changing in nature jobling 2014 pp 104 106 group was being mobbed by fans at some locations and bono became a sex symbol to female fans tour grossed about 2 million overall and was their first venture on road that was profitable jobling 2014 p 112 themes and legacy war tour was first u2 tour on which lighting and stage design was done by willie williams who would continue to perform that role in all of u2 s subsequent tours while originally hired for just lighting williams quickly became involved in all aspects of group s visual presentation starting with pre war tour minimalist stage design featured a red carpet covered riser on which drums and keyboards stood three large white flags were placed at back of stage representing notion of surrender electric fans set flags flying at designated moments in show stage fog was also used in places one newspaper review said that lighting was starkly beautiful for this concert in tune with occasional ominous tone of some of songs during sunday bloody sunday bono would march waving a white flag around to illustrate his anti war and anti nationalist stances and spur audiences to shout no more no war white flags were also sometimes handed off stage where they would be passed around amongst audience bono said that his limited voice compelled him to search for other ways to express a song s meaning and here this was idea of a flag drained of all colour idea of surrender this became focal image of tour with rolling stone saying of red rocks performance sight of bono singing anti violence anthem sunday bloody sunday while waving a white flag through crimson mist created by a combination of wet weather hot lights and illumination of those crags became defining image of u2 s warrior rock spirit so strong was image that group became somewhat ambivalent about it years later bassist adam clayton would say if you had to reduce u2 down to waving of white flag which is a moment from war tour that would be worst thing at time i think it was in spirit of performance but we weren t very ironic people back then we were pretty serious people and we didn t see that we could have been a little more subtle about things like that but hey as mistakes go that s probably not a bad one move upward from clubs to halls to arenas that war tour spanned did not faze group this had been their plan and bono said if we stay in small clubs we ll develop small minds and then we ll start making small music de la parra 2003 p 42 and early on bono had told williams that someday group would do pink floyd size shows but medium sized venues of war tour were enough at time two decades later band s red rocks performance captured on live at red rocks under a blood red sky was included on rolling stones list of 50 moments that changed history of rock and roll tour dates date city country 1 europe pre
