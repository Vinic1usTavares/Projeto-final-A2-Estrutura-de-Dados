niels henrik david bohr 7 october 1885 18 november 1962 was a danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory for which he received nobel prize in physics in 1922 bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research bohr developed bohr model of atom in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that electrons revolve in stable orbits around atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level or orbit to another although bohr model has been supplanted by other models its underlying principles remain valid he conceived principle of complementarity that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles notion of complementarity dominated bohr s thinking in both science and philosophy bohr founded institute of theoretical physics at university of copenhagen now known as niels bohr institute which opened in 1920 bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including hans kramers oskar klein george de hevesy and werner heisenberg he predicted existence of a new zirconium like element which was named hafnium after latin name for copenhagen where it was discovered later element bohrium was named after him during 1930s bohr helped refugees from nazism after denmark was occupied by germans he had a famous meeting with heisenberg who had become head of german nuclear weapon project in september 1943 word reached bohr that he was about to be arrested by germans and he fled to sweden from there he was flown to britain where he joined british tube alloys nuclear weapons project and was part of british mission to manhattan project after war bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy he was involved with establishment of cern and research establishment riso of danish atomic energy commission and became first chairman of nordic institute for theoretical physics in 1957 early years bohr was born in copenhagen denmark on 7 october 1885 second of three children of christian bohr a professor of physiology at university of copenhagen and ellen adler bohr who came from a wealthy danish jewish family prominent in banking and parliamentary circles he had an elder sister jenny and a younger brother harald jenny became a teacher while harald became a mathematician and footballer who played for danish national team at 1908 summer olympics in london niels was a passionate footballer as well and two brothers played several matches for copenhagen based akademisk boldklub academic football club with niels as goalkeeper there is no truth in oft repeated claim that bohr emulated his brother harald by playing for danish national team thumb left upright bohr as a young man alt head and shoulders of young man in a suit and tie bohr was educated at latin school starting when he was seven in 1903 bohr enrolled as an undergraduate at copenhagen university his major was physics which he studied under professor christian christiansen university s only professor of physics at that time he also studied astronomy and mathematics under professor thorvald thiele and philosophy under professor harald hoffding a friend of his father in 1905 a gold medal competition was sponsored by royal danish academy of sciences and letters to investigate a method for measuring surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by lord rayleigh in 1879 this involved measuring frequency of oscillation of radius of a water jet bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father s laboratory in university university itself had no physics laboratory to complete his experiments he had to make his own glassware creating test tubes with required elliptical cross sections he went beyond original task incorporating improvements into both rayleigh s theory and his method by taking into account viscosity of water and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones his essay which he submitted at last minute won prize he later submitted an improved version of paper to royal society in london for publication in philosophical transactions of royal society harald became first of two bohr brothers to earn a master s degree which he earned for mathematics in april 1909 niels took another nine months to earn his on electron theory of metals a topic assigned by his supervisor christiansen bohr subsequently elaborated his master s thesis into his much larger doctor of philosophy dr phil thesis he surveyed literature on subject settling on a model postulated by paul and elaborated by hendrik lorentz in which electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas bohr extended lorentz s model but was still unable to account for phenomena like hall effect and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain magnetic properties of metals thesis was accepted in april 1911 and bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 may harald had received his doctorate previous year bohr s thesis was groundbreaking but attracted little interest outside scandinavia because it was written in danish a copenhagen university requirement at time in 1921 dutch physicist johanna van leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from bohr s thesis that is today known as bohr van leeuwen theorem thumb right upright bohr and margrethe norlund on their engagement in 1910

his membership in church of denmark on 16 april 1912 and he and margrethe were married in a civil ceremony at town hall in slagelse on 1 august years later his brother harald similarly left church before getting married bohr and margrethe had six sons oldest christian died in a boating accident in 1934 and another harald died from childhood meningitis aage bohr became a successful physicist and in 1975 was awarded nobel prize in physics like his father became a physician a chemical engineer and ernest a lawyer like his uncle harald ernest bohr became an olympic athlete playing field hockey for denmark at 1948 summer olympics in london physics bohr model in september 1911 bohr supported by a fellowship from carlsberg foundation travelled to england at time it was where most of theoretical work on structure of atoms and molecules was being done he met j j thomson of cavendish laboratory and trinity college cambridge he attended lectures on electromagnetism given by james jeans and joseph larmor and did some research on cathode rays but failed to impress thomson he had more success with younger physicists like australian william lawrence bragg and new zealand s ernest rutherford whose 1911 small central nucleus rutherford model of atom had challenged thomson s 1904 plum pudding model bohr received an invitation from rutherford to conduct post doctoral work at victoria university of manchester where bohr met george de hevesy and charles galton darwin whom bohr referred to as grandson of real darwin bohr returned to denmark in july 1912 for his wedding and travelled around england and scotland on his honeymoon on his return he became a at university of copenhagen giving lectures on thermodynamics martin knudsen put bohr s name forward for a docent which was approved in july 1913 and bohr then began teaching medical students his three papers which later became famous as trilogy were published in philosophical magazine in july september and november of that year he adapted rutherford s nuclear structure to max planck s quantum theory and so created his bohr model of atom planetary models of atoms were not new but bohr s treatment was taking 1912 paper by darwin on role of electrons in interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point he advanced theory of electrons travelling in orbits around atom s nucleus with chemical properties of each element being largely determined by number of electrons in outer orbits of its atoms he introduced idea that an electron could drop from a higher energy orbit to a lower one in process emitting a quantum of discrete energy this became a basis for what is now known as old quantum theory thumb right bohr model of hydrogen atom a negatively charged electron confined to an

heisenberg schrodinger in 1885 johann balmer had come up with his balmer series to describe visible spectral lines of a hydrogen atom where l is wavelength of absorbed or emitted light and rh is rydberg constant balmer s formula was corroborated by discovery of additional spectral lines but for thirty years no one could explain why it worked in first paper of his trilogy bohr was able to derive it from his model where me is electron s mass e is its charge h is planck s constant and z is atom s atomic number 1 for hydrogen model s first hurdle was pickering series lines which did not fit balmer s formula when challenged on this by alfred fowler bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium helium atoms with only one electron bohr model was found to work for such ions many older physicists like thomson rayleigh and hendrik lorentz did not like trilogy but younger generation including rutherford david hilbert albert einstein enrico fermi max born and arnold sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough trilogy s acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments today bohr model of atom has been superseded but is still best known model of atom as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts bohr did not enjoy teaching medical students he decided to return to manchester where rutherford had offered him a job as a reader in place of darwin whose tenure had expired bohr accepted he took a leave of absence from university of copenhagen which he started by taking a holiday in tyrol with his brother harald and aunt hanna adler there he visited university of gottingen and ludwig maximilian university of munich where he met sommerfeld and conducted seminars on trilogy first world war broke out while they were in tyrol greatly complicating trip back to denmark and bohr s subsequent voyage with margrethe to england where he arrived in october 1914 they stayed until july 1916 by which time he had been appointed to chair of theoretical physics at university of copenhagen a position created especially for him his was abolished at same time so he still had to teach physics to medical students new professors were formally introduced to king christian x who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player institute of physics in april 1917 bohr began a campaign to establish an institute of theoretical physics he gained support of danish government and carlsberg foundation and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors many of them jewish legislation establishing institute was passed in november 1918 now known as niels bohr institute it opened on 3 march 1921 with bohr as its director his family moved into an apartment on first floor bohr s institute served as a focal point for researchers into quantum mechanics and related subjects in 1920s and 1930s when most of world s best known theoretical physicists spent some time in his company early arrivals included hans kramers from netherlands oskar klein from sweden george de hevesy from hungary wojciech from poland and svein rosseland from norway bohr became widely appreciated as their congenial host and eminent colleague klein and rosseland produced institute s first publication even before it opened thumb left niels bohr institute alt a block shaped beige building with a sloped red tiled roof bohr model worked well for hydrogen but could not explain more complex elements by 1919 bohr was moving away from idea that electrons orbited nucleus and developed heuristics to describe them rare earth elements posed a particular classification problem for chemists because they were so chemically similar an important development came in 1924 with wolfgang pauli s discovery of pauli exclusion principle which put bohr s models on a firm theoretical footing bohr was then able to declare that as yet undiscovered element 72 was not a rare earth element but an element with chemical properties similar to those of zirconium he was immediately challenged by french chemist georges urbain who claimed to have discovered a rare earth element 72 which he called celtium at institute in copenhagen dirk coster and george de hevesy took up challenge of proving bohr right and urbain wrong starting with a clear idea of chemical properties of unknown element greatly simplified search process they went through samples from copenhagen s museum of mineralogy looking for a zirconium like element and soon found it element which they named hafnium being latin name for copenhagen turned out to be more common than gold in 1922 bohr was awarded nobel prize in physics for his services in investigation of structure of atoms and of radiation emanating from them award thus recognised both trilogy and his early leading work in emerging field of quantum mechanics for his nobel lecture bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about structure of atom including correspondence principle which he had formulated this states that behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces classical physics in limit of large quantum numbers discovery of compton scattering by arthur holly compton in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of photons and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons in 1924 bohr kramers and john c slater an american physicist working at institute in copenhagen proposed bohr kramers slater theory bks it was more a programme than a full physical theory as ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively bks theory became final attempt at understanding interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on basis of old quantum theory in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of electromagnetic field modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using virtual oscillators at absorption and emission frequencies rather than different apparent frequencies of bohr orbits led max born werner heisenberg and kramers to explore different mathematical models they led to development of matrix mechanics first form of modern quantum mechanics bks theory also generated discussion of and renewed attention to difficulties in foundations of old quantum theory most provocative element of bks that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction but only statistically was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by walther bothe and hans geiger in light of these results bohr informed darwin that there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible quantum mechanics introduction of spin by george uhlenbeck and samuel goudsmit in november 1925 was a milestone next month bohr travelled to leiden to attend celebrations of 50th anniversary of hendrick lorentz receiving his doctorate when his train stopped in hamburg he was met by wolfgang pauli and otto stern who asked for his opinion of spin theory bohr pointed out that he had concerns about interaction between electrons and magnetic fields when he arrived in leiden paul ehrenfest and albert einstein informed bohr that einstein had resolved this problem using relativity bohr then had uhlenbeck and goudsmit incorporate this into their paper thus when he met werner heisenberg and pascual jordan in gottingen on way back he had become in his own words a prophet of electron magnet gospel heisenberg first came to copenhagen in 1924 then returned to gottingen in june 1925 shortly thereafter developing mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics when he showed his results to max born in gottingen born realised that they could best be expressed using matrices this work attracted attention of british physicist paul dirac who came to copenhagen for six months in september 1926 austrian physicist erwin schrodinger also visited in 1926 his attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed bohr who believed it contributed so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics when kramers left institute in 1926 to take up a chair as professor of theoretical physics at utrecht university bohr arranged for heisenberg to return and take kramers s place as a at university of copenhagen heisenberg worked in copenhagen as a university lecturer and assistant to bohr from 1926 to 1927 bohr became convinced that light behaved like both waves and particles and in 1927 experiments confirmed de broglie hypothesis that matter like electrons also behaved like waves he conceived philosophical principle of complementarity that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties such as being a wave or a stream of particles depending on experimental framework he felt that it was not fully understood by professional philosophers in copenhagen in 1927 heisenberg developed his uncertainty principle which bohr embraced in a paper he presented at volta conference at como in september 1927 he demonstrated that uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments without quantum terminology or matrices einstein preferred determinism of classical physics over probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed philosophical issues that arose from novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion einstein and bohr had good natured arguments over such issues throughout their lives in 1914 carl jacobsen heir to carlsberg breweries bequeathed his mansion to be used for life by dane who had made most prominent contribution to science literature or arts as an honorary residence harald hoffding had been first occupant and upon his death in july 1931 royal danish academy of sciences and letters gave bohr occupancy he and his family moved there in 1932 he was elected president of academy on 17 march 1939 by 1929 phenomenon of beta decay prompted bohr to again suggest that law of conservation of energy be abandoned but enrico fermi s hypothetical neutrino and subsequent 1932 discovery of neutron provided another explanation this prompted bohr to create a new theory of compound nucleus in 1936 which explained how neutrons could be captured by nucleus in this model nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid he worked on this with a new collaborator danish physicist fritz kalckar who died suddenly in 1938 discovery of nuclear fission by otto hahn in december 1938 and its theoretical explanation by lise meitner generated intense interest among physicists bohr brought news to united states where he opened fifth washington conference on theoretical physics with fermi on 26 january 1939 when bohr told george placzek that this resolved all mysteries of transuranic elements placzek told him that one remained neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to placzek leon rosenfeld and john wheeler that i have understood everything based on his liquid drop model of nucleus bohr concluded that it was uranium 235 isotope and not more abundant uranium 238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons in april 1940 john r dunning demonstrated that bohr was correct in meantime bohr and wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a september 1939 paper on mechanism of nuclear fission philosophy bohr read 19th century danish christian existentialist philosopher soren kierkegaard richard rhodes argued in making of atomic bomb that bohr was influenced by kierkegaard through hoffding in 1909 bohr sent his brother kierkegaard s stages on life s way as a birthday gift in enclosed letter bohr wrote it is only thing i have to send home but i do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better i even think it is one of most delightful things i have ever read bohr enjoyed kierkegaard s language and literary style but mentioned that he had some disagreement with kierkegaard s philosophy some of bohr s biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from kierkegaard s advocacy of christianity while bohr was an atheist a statement about religion in loose notes on kierkegaard may throw light on notion of wildness that appears in many of bohr s letters i who do not feel in any way united with and even less bound to a god and therefore am also much poorer than kierkegaard would say that good is overall lofty goal as only by being good can one judge according to worth and right bohr s sort of humor use of parables and stories tolerance dependence on family feelings of indebtedness obligation and guilt and his sense of responsibility for science community and ultimately humankind in general are common traits of jewish intellectual so too is a well fortified atheism bohr ended with no religious belief and a dislike of all religions that claimed to base their teachings on revelations there has been some dispute over extent to which kierkegaard influenced bohr s philosophy and science david argued that kierkegaard had minimal influence over bohr s work taking bohr s statement about disagreeing with kierkegaard at face value while jan faye argued that one can disagree with content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure nazism and second world war rise of nazism in germany prompted many scholars to flee their countries either because they were jewish or because they were political opponents of nazi regime in 1933 rockefeller foundation created a fund to help support refugee academics and bohr discussed this programme with president of rockefeller foundation max mason in may 1933 during a visit to united states bohr offered refugees temporary jobs at institute provided them with financial support arranged for them to be awarded fellowships from rockefeller foundation and ultimately found them places at institutions around world those that he helped included guido beck felix bloch james franck george de hevesy otto frisch hilde levi lise meitner george placzek eugene stefan erich ernst schneider edward teller arthur von hippel and victor weisskopf in april 1940 early in second world war nazi germany invaded and occupied denmark to prevent germans from discovering max von laue s and james franck s gold nobel medals bohr had de hevesy dissolve them in aqua regia in this form they were stored on a shelf at institute until after war when gold was precipitated and medals re struck by nobel foundation bohr s own medal had been donated to an auction to fund for finnish relief and was auctioned off in march of 1940 along with medal of august krogh buyer later donated two medals to danish historical museum in frederiksborg castle where they are still kept bohr kept institute running but all foreign scholars departed meeting with heisenberg thumb right werner heisenberg

bottles bohr was aware of possibility of using uranium 235 to construct an atomic bomb referring to it in lectures in britain and denmark shortly before and after war started but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium 235 in september 1941 heisenberg who had become head of german nuclear energy project visited bohr in copenhagen during this meeting two men took a private moment outside content of which has caused much speculation as both gave differing accounts according to heisenberg he began to address nuclear energy morality and war to which bohr seems to have reacted by terminating conversation abruptly while not giving heisenberg hints about his own opinions ivan supek one of heisenberg s students and friends claimed that main subject of meeting was carl friedrich von weizsacker who had proposed trying to persuade bohr to mediate peace between britain and germany an interview with ivan supek relating to 1941 bohr heisenberg meeting in 1957 heisenberg wrote to robert jungk who was then working on book brighter than a thousand suns a personal history of atomic scientists heisenberg explained that he had visited copenhagen to communicate to bohr views of several german scientists that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts and this raised enormous responsibilities on world s scientists on both sides when bohr saw jungk s depiction in danish translation of book he drafted but never sent a letter to heisenberg stating that he never understood purpose of heisenberg s visit was shocked by heisenberg s opinion that germany would win war and that atomic weapons could be decisive michael frayn s 1998 play copenhagen explores what might have happened at 1941 meeting between heisenberg and bohr a bbc television film version of play was first screened on 26 september 2002 with stephen rea as bohr and daniel craig as heisenberg same meeting had previously been dramatised by bbc s horizon science documentary series in 1992 with anthony bate as bohr and philip anthony as heisenberg horizon hitler s bomb bbc two 24 february 1992 meeting is also dramatized in norwegian danish british miniseries heavy water war manhattan project in september 1943 word reached bohr and his brother harald that nazis considered their family to be jewish since their mother was jewish and that they were therefore in danger of being arrested danish resistance helped bohr and his wife escape by sea to sweden on 29 september next day bohr persuaded king gustaf v of sweden to make public sweden s willingness to provide asylum to jewish refugees on 2 october 1943 swedish radio broadcast that sweden was ready to offer asylum and mass rescue of danish jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter some historians claim that bohr s actions led directly to mass rescue while others say that though bohr did all that he could for his countrymen his actions were not a decisive influence on wider events eventually over 7 000 danish jews escaped to sweden thumb left bohr with james franck albert einstein and isidor isaac rabi lr when news of bohr s escape reached britain lord cherwell sent a telegram to bohr asking him to come to britain bohr arrived in scotland on 6 october in a de havilland mosquito operated by british overseas airways corporation boac mosquitos were unarmed high speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small valuable cargoes or important passengers by flying at high speed and high altitude they could cross german occupied norway and yet avoid german fighters bohr equipped with parachute flying suit and oxygen mask spent three hour flight lying on a mattress in aircraft s bomb bay during flight bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small and consequently did not hear pilot s intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly norway he passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when aircraft descended to lower altitude over north sea bohr s son aage followed his father to britain on another flight a week later and became his personal assistant bohr was warmly received by james chadwick and sir john anderson but for security reasons bohr was kept out of sight he was given an apartment at st james s palace and an office with british tube alloys nuclear weapons development team bohr was astonished at amount of progress that had been made chadwick arranged for bohr to visit united states as a tube alloys consultant with aage as his assistant on 8 december 1943 bohr arrived in washington d c where he met with director of manhattan project brigadier general leslie r groves jr he visited einstein and pauli at institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey and went to los alamos in new mexico where nuclear weapons were being designed for security reasons he went under name of nicholas baker in united states while aage became james baker in may 1944 danish resistance newspaper de danske reported that they had learned that famous son of denmark professor niels bohr in october previous year had fled his country via sweden to london and from there travelled to moscow from where he could be assumed to support war effort bohr did not remain at los alamos but paid a series of extended visits over course of next two years robert oppenheimer credited bohr with acting as a scientific father figure to younger men most notably richard feynman bohr is quoted as saying they didn t need my help in making atom bomb oppenheimer gave bohr credit for an important contribution to work on modulated neutron initiators this device remained a stubborn puzzle oppenheimer noted but in early february 1945 niels bohr clarified what had to be done bohr recognised early that nuclear weapons would change international relations in april 1944 he received a letter from peter kapitza written some months before when bohr was in sweden inviting him to come to soviet union letter convinced bohr that soviets were aware of anglo american project and would strive to catch up he sent kapitza a non committal response which he showed to authorities in britain before posting bohr met churchill on 16 may 1944 but found that we did not speak same language churchill disagreed with idea of openness towards russians to point that he wrote in a letter it seems to me bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near edge of mortal crimes oppenheimer suggested that bohr visit president franklin d roosevelt to convince him that manhattan project should be shared with soviets in hope of speeding up its results bohr s friend supreme court justice felix frankfurter informed president roosevelt about bohr s opinions and a meeting between them took place on 26 august 1944 roosevelt suggested that bohr return to united kingdom to try to win british approval when churchill and roosevelt met at hyde park on 19 september 1944 they rejected idea of informing world about project and aide memoire of their conversation contained a rider that enquiries should be made regarding activities of professor bohr and steps taken to ensure that he is responsible for no leakage of information particularly to russians in june 1950 bohr addressed an open letter to united nations calling for international cooperation on nuclear energy in 1950s after soviet union s first nuclear weapon test international atomic energy agency was created along lines of bohr s suggestion in 1957 he received first ever atoms for peace award later years thumb right 240px upright bohr s coat of arms 1947 argent a taijitu yin yang symbol gules and sable motto sunt opposites are complementary with war now ended bohr returned to copenhagen on 25 august 1945 and was re elected president of royal danish academy of arts and sciences on 21 september at a memorial meeting of academy on 17 october 1947 for king christian x who had died in april new king frederick ix announced that he was conferring order of elephant on bohr this award was normally awarded only to royalty and heads of state but king said that it honoured not just bohr personally but danish science bohr designed his own coat of arms which featured a taijitu symbol of yin and yang and a motto in opposites are complementary second world war demonstrated that science and physics in particular now required considerable financial and material resources to avoid a brain drain to united states twelve european countries banded together to create cern a research organisation along lines of national laboratories in united states designed to undertake big science projects beyond resources of any one of them alone questions soon arose regarding best location for facilities bohr and kramers felt that institute in copenhagen would be ideal site pierre auger who organised preliminary discussions disagreed he felt that both bohr and his institute were past their prime and that bohr s presence would overshadow others after a long debate bohr pledged his support to cern in february 1952 and geneva was chosen as site in october cern theory group was based in copenhagen until their new accommodation in geneva was ready in 1957 victor weisskopf who later became director general of cern summed up bohr s role saying that there were other personalities who started and conceived idea of cern enthusiasm and ideas of other people would not have been enough however if a man of his stature had not supported it meanwhile scandinavian countries formed nordic institute for theoretical physics in 1957 with bohr as its chairman he was also involved with founding of research establishment riso of danish atomic energy commission and served as its first chairman from february 1956 bohr died of heart failure at his home in carlsberg on 18 november 1962 he was cremated and his ashes were buried in family plot in cemetery in section of copenhagen along with those of his parents his brother harald and his son christian years later his wife s ashes were also interred there on 7 october 1965 on what would have been his 80th birthday institute for theoretical physics at university of copenhagen was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years niels bohr institute accolades bohr received numerous honours and accolades in addition to nobel prize he received hughes medal in 1921 matteucci medal in 1923 franklin medal in 1926 copley medal in 1938 order of elephant in 1947 atoms for peace award in 1957 and sonning prize in 1961 he became foreign member of royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in 1923 and of royal society in 1926 bohr model s semicentennial was commemorated in denmark on 21 november 1963 with a postage stamp depicting bohr hydrogen atom and formula for difference of any two hydrogen energy levels several other countries have also issued postage stamps depicting bohr in
