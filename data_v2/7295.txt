pierce said story in christmas scandal was so busy that it risked running awry but was kept together by a number of strong comedic moments and subplots pierce particularly enjoyed watching parks department scrambling to do leslie s work and chemistry between both april and andy and leslie and dave alan sepinwall television columnist with star ledger said he thoroughly enjoyed episode especially subplot of parks department employees realizing how much work leslie does due to her absence however he said way sex scandal consumed entire town and local media countered central conceit of series that leslie treats her mundane small town civil service job as if it were a high stakes national politics job while everyone else sees their world for what it is matt fowler of ign said episode was a sweet and clever way to celebrate holiday season but that media frenzy in christmas scandal was a little out of place in an episode filled with a ton of subtler character building moments fowler said parks department employees splitting up to do leslie s work was a great element that helped develop leslie s character dvd release christmas scandal along with other 23 second
