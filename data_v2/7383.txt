experience one of great emotional depth life is people brims with compassion vulnerability and tenderness it is not a comeback record but a late continuation a great work of art drew of consequence of sound wrote that little has changed fay s songs sound as if they ve simply been hanging out in ether for all these years just waiting to be put to tape life is people makes a strong argument for why fay deserves recognition and not just by those in know daily telegraphs neil mccormick called album a belated triumph which unfolds with assurance of an old master still burning with desire to tell his tales saying that it was so much stronger than latter day works of many of fay s contemporaries critic tom hughes of guardian was less complimentary noting that album was not without a few syrupy moments and it would be a push to recommend it over old records but concluded that there are some fine songs here andy gill writing for independent said that fay has finally created masterpiece that will secure his reputation and added that life is people was truly album of a lifetime daniel paton of musicomh said that life is people may not quite be masterpiece so many people dearly want it to be that being said there are moments here so sublime and moving that could only have come from fay pitchfork reviewer grayson currin remarked that life is people and tale that accompany it are strong enough to at last make fay s reputation among many match his legacy among few saying that at risk of overstating case life is people work of a 69 year old family man and work of a lifetime confirms its maker s own thesis critic maria of popmatters wrote that one half of fay s life is people proves worthy of such a long wait those who life is people touches are unlikely to hear a more inspiring album this year prefix magazine s matthew stated that while it does have its missteps life is people may not be best bill fay but hearing this there is no doubt about one thing it s great to have him back and hopefully this record is just start of that return life is people was featured in several publications end of year lists ranking at number three on mojos list of best albums of 2012 number
