increasingly more difficult demonic entities progressively more powerful armor and weapons can be purchased for each character from specialized shops in towns throughout world and new skills can be learned to help player complete tougher challenges special devices called tools unique to each character allow player to traverse otherwise impassable situations while not in battle these items are obtained at certain points in game and allow hidden areas or pathways to be discovered as well as destroy objects and solve puzzles rudy s bomb tool for example can demolish large rocks and other impediments while jack s grappling hook allows party to cross large gaps and chasms while avoiding traps battle system unlike normal gameplay where all character and background graphics are two dimensional 2d combat is rendered entirely in 3d wild arms uses a turn based battle system in which player inputs commands at start of each round designating which actions take place order in which each character and enemy performs these actions is based on their response res statistic which denotes how quickly a particular character can act higher a character s response more likely they are to act before an enemy player has option every round to either use a restorative item from their inventory use a special skill run from combat or attack enemy units are defeated when their hit points a numerical representation of their vitality reaches zero hit points can be reduced by attacking an enemy either with standard attacks or spells each of three playable characters has a unique set of abilities that can be used to defeat enemies or aid party members rudy utilizes arms powerful yet limited attacks involving gun like weapons that rely on a set number of bullets jack s fast draw sword techniques can damage opponents in a variety of ways and cecilia s magic can either benefit party by restoring hit points raising statistics or damage enemies with harmful spells additionally a character can equip special items called runes allowing them to summon powerful guardians to aid them in battle new skills are acquired as main story progresses completing side quests or purchasing them from an in game shop magic during combat each character has a force bar divided into 4 equal sized sections called levels as bar s level increases player is given access to one of four force techniques made available through different areas of gameplay these techniques allow a character to perform a special action each time they attack or use a skill adding to their overall effectiveness cecilia s mystic ability for example allows an item to be used to cast a spell whether it be an attack restorative or assist spell and jack s accelerator gives him option of acting first in next combat round regardless of his or enemy s speed more effective skill more force bar levels move requires like normal equipment runes can alter a character s statistics to make them more proficient in certain areas of combat such as raising their strength statistic increasing damage they cause with normal attacks equipping these items has added benefit of allowing a character to call upon powerful magic creatures to attack all enemies at once or aid allies with beneficial magic runes can be obtained either in hidden areas within dungeons or simply whenever story wills it most guardian attacks like cecilia s magic have a certain elemental designation that is more effective against certain enemies plot setting wild arms takes place in world of filgaia in original japanese version a fantasy world modeled closely after american old west and medieval europe wild west motif is present throughout entirety of game and though several different landforms and climates exist across entirety of world vast deserts wide gorges canyons and sparse grasslands make up majority of landscape a number of towns and villages exist some containing old world european architecture and castles while others resemble early american frontier towns and trade posts technology at time of game is set around early industrial revolution with advancements such as motors first coming into use a recurring theme throughout game is destructive technology such as guns and firearms being seen as dangerous and therefore forbidden technology that is feared by general populace since most of world s most advanced technology existed centuries before start of game archaeologists and engineers are essentially one and same rediscovering old technology as they find new applications for it characters in addition to several supporting characters and villains wild arms features three playable characters rudy roughnight ragunaito rodi ragunaito rody roughnight in japanese version and rudy in subsequent english translations is a 15 year old boy from a remote village who was orphaned several years before beginning of game when his grandfather died under care of town s mayor rudy worked as a farmhand for his neighbor until day a local boy searching for medicinal herbs to heal his ailing father became lost in a cave just outside town rushing to save him rudy eventually finds and rescues child yet inadvertently frees a zombie sealed within cavern he is able to defeat zombie and save village but alerts villagers to his forbidden arm weapon in process causing him to be cast out of village and forcing him to live on his own returning to life of an adventurer and drifter after severing his own arm by sword in wild arms and by gun in wild arms alter code f rudy is discovered to be a an artificial being designed to be a weapon that shares basic physiology of metal demons which were terminated since they were labeled as being extremely violent and dangerous but rudy was adopted by a man called zepet who assumed role of his grandfather and cared for him giving rudy a heart and capacity to care and love steering him away from being a weapon of mass destruction like his brethren rudy s character exemplifies role playing game archetype of silent protagonist and is meant to act as player s extension into game though he does have one line in game cecilia lynn adlehyde seshiria rein a seshiria rein cecilia adlehyde in japanese version is a young mage who has spent most of her life studying at abbey magic school her 17th birthday at beginning of game marks her official ascension into adlehyde royal family and departure from school before she is able to leave however she is contacted by a mysterious voice who beckons her to a hidden library deep within abbey it is there that she confronts and defeats a demon using her fledgling magic skills and frees a powerful entity known as a guardian from a sealed book guardian informs cecilia that her royal blood allows her to be a medium between real world and spirit dimension occupied by avatars of all world s elemental forces and that she will be instrumental in securing future and reconstruction of barren planet throughout her life she has disliked being just a figurehead known as cecilia princess and not as cecilia girl one of her reasons for joining rudy and jack was so she would not be lonely it is hinted

humans managed to capture demon s leader mother and sealed her deep within a castle in tundra of arctica unable to completely destroy her constantly regenerating body people of arctica removed her heart and tore it into three pieces imprisoned her within a cocoon and sealed pieces of her heart inside three stone statues which they spread across world with their leader gone a majority of demons disappeared with only a few remaining in seclusion over next few centuries eventually launching an attack on castle to reclaim incapacitated body of mother ryan a surprise attack within snowstorm maybe they re after chief maybe demons are after cocoon i don t have much time so let me get to point all right will you give me that thing you call a cocoon wild arms succeeding in their mission a small band of demon warriors known as quarter knights kept watch over body of mother in their fortress protected behind a powerful force field and began gathering information as to whereabouts of guardian statues with hope of one day reviving her and claiming filgaia as their own zeikfried it s been 1000 years since we came here loss of our home world we came to this planet to make it our home power rules all this place will belong to us wild arms as time passed talk of ancient invasion began to dwindle though stories of demonic weaponry such as arms and robotic soldiers still persisted in minds of many when a mysterious child named rudy drifted into small town of surf he came with an arm at his side though he is able to hide it for a time his arm makes him into a pariah after he is involved with a disastrous earthquake i know about you you possess arm forbidden power i know i shouldn t have but i looked through your stuff other day arm has brought doom upon us all wild arms making his way to city of adlehyde rudy meets cecilia a magician in training and successor to adlehyde royal family and jack a headstrong treasure hunter trio teams up for first time to help a local

robotic creature called a golem three adventurers escort emma and their discovery back to adlehyde to exhibit it at town s ruin festival emma yes this is one of eight golems isn t it cute this thing is unbreakable it s still in mint condition and it s completely dormant wild arms during event where several other golem creatures are on display a small army of demons led by belselk of quarter knights proceed to burn town steal golems and mortally wound cecilia s father king in order to spare remaining people of adlehyde cecilia gives belselk her family heirloom a pendant called tear drop that has magical properties which demons believe can be used as a catalyst for reviving their leader cecilia what do demons want with tear drop do they want to destroy world with it gurdijeff with tear drop it is possible demons however are trying to use it to revive their master mother wild arms when invaders recall from town rudy and his friends make a pact to stop knights from taking control of filgaia and to restore balance to weakening elemental forces of world that have been in decline since demons initial invasion traveling across filgaia heroes make their way to long abandoned guardian temple to gain alliance of mystical guardians who maintain forces of nature across planet there they are tested individually after each of them fails their personal tests of character guardians reluctantly agree to aid them gurdijeff because you are weak you seek power we shall give you power that you seek but time is running out you will have power to summon us into your reality take our powers before they weaken any further and stop demons from regenerating mother we shall send our warriors to their lair wild arms guardians tell rudy and his companions that demons have already begun to revive their leader and have only to lift seal on her cocoon like prison by destroying three scattered statues that lie across filgaia chief during war 1000 years ago demon queen s heart was torn into three pieces and sealed in three separate guardian statues they are planning an all out attack after revival of their queen wild arms utilizing ancient elw technology in form of teleportation devices group travels world to stop quarter knights from destroying statues but they fail in each attempt consequent resurrection of mother occurs yet demons are informed by their leader that it is her intention to eradicate filgaia rather than subjugate it and tells her followers that their own deaths will follow soon after mother rule order what do those things have to do with me filgaia will end up just like other worlds i ve been to flame of life is most beautiful at its scattering end end of a planet is ultimate beauty supplied by universe wild arms realizing that only way to defeat demons is to confront them in their stronghold photosphere rudy jack and cecilia gather necessary materials to enter tomb of last remaining golem earth golem asgard convincing him to aid them in their struggle cecilia no it s not our weapon it s joining us as a member of group please lend me your big hand for future a future where you re no longer needed as a weapon wild arms asgard neutralizes protective seal around photosphere granting rudy jack and cecilia access with aid of a blue hooded figure heroes are able to re acquire cecilia s tear drop previously acting as power source to entire fortress and confront a weakened mother directly destroying her body just as photosphere sinks into ocean thinking worst to be over trio depart for adlehyde when they are confronted by quarter knights who inform them of their plan to take over filgaia in their maniacal leader s absence and blue hooded character who assisted them was leader of quarter knights who betrayed mother emma from what i ve heard it sounds like enemy is stepping up their plans total annihilation of all life on filgaia and complete destruction of guardians powers wild arms demons attempt to destroy ray line underneath filgaia it was last resort of guardians to connect their remaining strength together and maintain planet these plans are temporarily thwarted at last moment with zeikfried being thrown through a dimensional rift in space when three confront him finding himself transported to underwater wreckage of photosphere is met by a deformed visage of mother who devours him zeikfried no way i m back on control chair of photosphere that was close i thought i was going to be lost in another dimension although it s ironic that i m back at this place of hatred hatred between a child and a parent wild arms however remaining demons find another way to disrupt ray line by creating their own tear drop designed to destroy rather than create life and using elw teleportation system distribute it all over filgaia throwing forces of nature into chaos it is also revealed that one of quarter knights was not originally a demon but jack s lost love elmina which fueled his lust for vengeance later demons learn of a giant structure on one of moons orbiting planet malduke that was designed to be a space station for residential and military purposes possessing a powerful weapon that could destroy filgaia inside demons newly arisen tower ka dingel that connects with malduke rudy jack and cecilia confront what remains of their adversaries before reaching teleportation device to take them to malduke within malduke s deepest sanctum they confront zeikfried who transforms into a revived mother this new being motherfried confronts heroes with intent of using malduke s primary weapon to destroy filgaia but is defeated motherfried even if my flesh is destroyed i will always have a home at end of time filgaia will not be able to escape darkness that is upon it nothing can stop end from arriving wild arms however even after defeating last of demons it seems too late to stop malduke s weapon from destroying filgaia but guardians are able to pool their strength and revive world rudy jack and cecilia board teleportation device to be transported back to filgaia only to be stopped in mid voyage by what is left of zeikfried s body and his spear weakened zeikfried launches a last desperate assault on heroes and though defeated in end energy released in battle destabilizes portal zeik tuvai as i said before battle in artificial space is very risky our previous battle was nothing compared to this we will all be blown away wild arms narrowly escaping through portal to filgaia trio arrives at ka dingel just as it collapses with asgard arriving to shield them from falling debris but sheer strain causes great damage to earth golem and so is later allowed to sleep once more beneath earth with cecilia s help with demons defeated and nature beginning to recover jack and rudy set off on a new journey while cecilia remains in adlehyde to fulfill her duties as ruler in a letter she writes to jack and rudy she tells them that she will send them item they forgot to help them on their future adventures and shows up shortly after to join them on a new quest cecilia am i not supposed to be here i m delivering to you item that you forgot wild arms development wild arms
