honduran white bat ectophylla alba also called caribbean white tent making bat is a species of bat in family it is only member of genus ectophylla genus and species were both scientifically described for first time in 1892 it has distinctive entirely white fur which is only found in six of roughly 1 300 known species of bat it constructs tents out of understory plant leaves by strategically cutting leaf ribs with its teeth it roosts in these tents during day it is a specialist frugivore consuming almost exclusively fruits of one species of fig females can likely become pregnant twice per year giving birth to one offspring at a time it is found in honduras nicaragua costa rica and western panama at elevations from sea level to due to habitat loss it is evaluated as near threatened by iucn its bright yellow ears nose leaf and lips are a result of carotenoid deposition mechanism of this deposition is being researched as a way to understand and combat macular degeneration in humans taxonomy and phylogeny honduran white bat was described as a new species ectophylla alba in 1892 by american zoologist harrison allen holotype that allen used to describe new genus and species was collected by charles haskins townsend near coco river in honduras in 1887 it belongs to leaf nosed bat family phyllostomidae within phyllostomidae it is in subfamily macconnell s bat was once included in genus ectophylla but it is now monotypic within despite no longer being classified in same genus macconnell s bat and honduran white bat are sister taxa they are each other s closest relative see phylogeny at left currently honduran white bat is only member of ectophylla genus name ectophylla is from ancient greek meaning out and meaning leaf referring to its nose leaf its species name alba comes from latin albus meaning white description left thumbnail individual captured via mist net costa rica like both its common name and specific epithet suggest honduran white bat has bright white fur tips of individual hairs are gray with grayish coloration more pronounced towards bat s posterior this species along with four diclidurus species and ghost bat gigas is among only currently known species of bat more than 1 300 species have been described where pelage is all white its large nose leaf easily distinguishes it from northern ghost bat diclidurus albus however which is only white bat with which it is sympatric having an overlapping geographic range its wing membranes are black its ears tragi cartilaginous projections in front of ear openings nose leaf and lips are a bright yellowish orange its yellow orange pigmentation is due to large concentrations of carotenoids particularly xanthophyll it is first mammal known to have enough carotenoids in its skin to generate conspicuous color a 2019 study found that while brightness of yellow pigment of ears did not vary significantly between adults and juveniles yellow chroma relative to brightness of ears did differ with age adult bats had higher yellow chroma in their ears than did juveniles yellow of nose leaf however had more variation adult males nose leaves are a brighter yellow than those of adult females juveniles of each sex did not differ in nose leaf brightness adult males also had significantly brighter nose leaves than juvenile males similarly to ears yellow chroma of nose leaf was greater in adults than in juveniles though not different between sexes authors suggested that color difference of male and female nose leaves is indicative of sexual dichromatism meaning that females may select for males with brighter nose leaves this conclusion was supported by trend that males with brighter yellow nose leaves tended to have better body conditions females could thus use nose leaf color as a metric of male fitness when selecting a mate it is a small species with a head and body length of a forearm length of and an ear length of individuals weigh only bat s nose leaf is erect its tail is absent and its ears large and rounded inner margin of is convex while outer margin is coarsely serrated with four or five small lobes nose leaf also has a serrated margin it has eight to ten small warts under its mouth its dental formula is for a total of 28 teeth its skull is similar in appearance to other species in its subfamily with exception of its very deep basioccipital pits bat overall resembles a small white biology and ecology tent making thumb right heliconia latispatha which is a plant species used for tent roosting costa rica honduran white bat is one of approximately 22 known species of bats that roost within leaf tents honduran white bat cuts side veins extending out from midrib of large leaves of heliconia plant causing them to fold down to form a tent tents are likely constructed by multiple individuals females have been observed constructing tents but it is likely that males do so as well new tents are constructed throughout year as modifying leaves into tents causes leaves to die once modified into a tent a leaf lives approximately 7 5 weeks compared to 61 weeks in an unmodified leaf several species of heliconia are used as roosts including h imbricata h latispatha h h tortuosa and h rarely it has been documented using and plants as roosts in selecting leaves to turn into tents it appears that age and size of leaf is more important than species of plant preferred leaves are long and less than 30 days old younger leaves may be preferred because they are easier to bite through and shape than older leaves it also prefers leaves that are less than above forest floor preferred leaves are in areas of low understory vegetation density but high canopy vegetation density heliconia density is lower surrounding chosen leaves than would be expected if bats selected leaves randomly features such as canopy density may help tent maintain a consistent microclimate tents are usually with little fluctuation high canopy density could also protect its tent from disturbance from wind and rain because tent construction takes up to several weeks worth of time from several individuals choosing more sheltered tents could prolong life of a tent and protect bats investment low understory vegetation density is thought to be beneficial by providing an uncluttered airspace for bats as they exit and enter their tents it clings to roof of its tent in small colonies of 1 15 individuals tent protects it from rain and predators rather than roosting in a single tent consistently honduran white bat has a network of tents scattered across forest it alternates among these tents for roosting single tents have been consistently occupied for up to 45 days although their tents are typically low to ground sunlight filters through leaf which gives their white fur a greenish cast this almost completely conceals them if they remain still alternately it has been proposed that its white fur gives it appearance of a wasp nest which would be avoided by predators it likely has several predators including capuchin monkeys central american squirrel monkeys and snakes diet and foraging honduran white bat is frugivorous along with little white shouldered bat honduran white bat is one of two smallest species of frugivorous bat in world it specializes on a species of fig ficus colubrinae however other species of figs are occasionally consumed such as ficus honduran white bat prefers f colubrinae trees that are high quality or produce many fruits at once it also chooses fig trees that are closest to its day roosts f colubrinae trees have asynchronous fruit production so its fruits are available as a food source year round because it is highly specialized on one species of fig it has larger foraging movements than observed in frugivorous bats that are less specialized individuals have an average home range of it is unclear how it manages to survive on such a narrow diet as it is predicted it should have to consume supplemental food sources reproduction little is known about honduran white bat s reproductive behaviors it has been proposed that individuals give birth in april and september and that estrus occurs post parturition pregnant females have been documented in february march june july and august in costa rica with lactating females documented in march and april females have synchronized births with all births in a colony occurring within same week litter size is one offspring called a pup during lactation mothers will return to their roosts up to six times a night to feed their pups pups fledge or become capable of flight at 3 4 weeks old range and habitat right thumb national park a location where this species is found costa rica honduran white bat is found in several countries in central america including costa rica honduras nicaragua and panama unusually it is one of four species of leaf nosed bat endemic to central america most are found in south america its range encompasses a range of elevations from above sea level it prefers wet evergreen forests and secondary forests which can accommodate its specific roosting and dietary requirements conservation despite being a conspicuously colored bat over sixty years passed between discovery of first honduran white bat in 1898 and next discovery in 1963 it is currently evaluated as near threatened by iucn it meets criteria for this designation because its population is in a significant decline decline does not exceed 30 population loss over past three generations approximately 18 years in this species which would qualify it for vulnerable designation however it is on verge of qualifying for vulnerable designation reasons for its population decline include conversion of its habitat to farmland as well as an expanding human population it is particularly susceptible to habitat loss because it is highly specialized on a single species of fig for its food source human health applications in 2016 it was discovered that white bat uses carotenoids to produce yellow orange coloration of its ears nose leaf and lips it was first mammalian species to be documented with high enough concentrations of carotenoids to produce visible skin coloration it isolates pigments from its diet particularly fruits of ficus colubrinae tree lutein carotenoid responsible for its yellow pigmentation is present in its skin in its esterified form while in its free form in liver this suggests that honduran white bats possess a physiological mechanism to convert free lutein to esterified lutein which humans are unable to do lutein plays an important role in eyes by preventing damage to retina it is hypothesized that if free lutein in human eyes was esterified it would be more effective at preventing damage and preserving vision understanding process by which honduran white bats convert free lutein to esterified lutein could assist in understanding of how stability and bioavailability of carotenoids benefit human health in particular species may have research applications for understanding and treating macular degeneration in humans references external links a video of a honduran white bat foraging for figs at night category
