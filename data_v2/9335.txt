thumb replica triarius metal mail armor gladius and shield on display at flavian amphitheater rome italy triarii singular triarius were one of elements of early roman military manipular legions of early roman republic 509 bc 107 bc they were oldest and among wealthiest men in army and could afford high quality equipment they wore heavy metal armor and carried large shields their usual position being third battle line they were equipped with spears and were considered to be elite soldiers among legion during camillan era they fought in a shallow phalanx formation supported by light troops in most battles triarii were not used because lighter troops usually defeated enemy before triarii were committed to battle they were meant to be used as a decisive force in battle thus prompting an old roman saying it comes down to triarii res ad triarios venit which meant carrying on to bitter end gaspar j 1850 01 01 de la mas pura e con noticias de geografia costumbres e historia romana para uso

southern triarii may have evolved from old first class of army under etruscan kings first class comprised richest soldiers in legion who were equipped with spears breastplates and large shields like heavy greek hoplites they served as heavy infantry in early roman army and were used at front of a very large phalanx formation after a time engagements with samnites and gauls appear to have taught romans importance of flexibility and inadequacy of phalanx on rough hilly ground of central italy camillan era by 4th century bc military formations romans had inherited from etruscans were still in use though their efficiency was doubtful they proved effective against rome s largely local adversaries when gauls invaded etruria in 390 bc inhabitants requested help from rome small contingent rome sent to repel gallic invaders provoked a full scale attack on rome and entire roman army was destroyed at battle of allia this crushing defeat prompted a series of military reforms by marcus furius camillus under new system men were sorted into classes according to wealth triarii being richest after mounted equites triarii were armed with spears or hastae about 2 metres 6 1 2 feet long they also carried swords or gladii about 84 centimetres 29 inches long in case spear broke or enemy drew too close they fought as hoplites usually carrying large round greek shields and wearing bronze helmets often with a number of feathers fixed onto top to increase stature heavy plate armour was favoured with mail also being popular many would paint or engrave portraits of ancestors onto their shield believing that it would bring them luck in battle in this new type of unit 900 triarii formed 15 maniples military units of 60 men each which were in turn part of 15 ordines larger units made up of a maniple of triarii a maniple of rorarii and a maniple of accensi triarii stood in third line of legion behind front line of hastati and second line of principes and in front of rorarii and accensi in a pitched battle leves javelin armed skirmishers who were attached to maniples of hastati would form up at front of legion and harass enemy with javelin fire and cover advance of hastati spear armed infantry if hastati failed to break enemy they would fall back and let principes heavier and more experienced infantry take over if principes did not break them they would retire behind triarii who would then engage enemy in turn hence expression rem ad triarios it has come to triarii signaling an act of desperation equites cavalrymen were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies rorarii poorer reserve soldiers and accensi least dependable troops armed with slings would be used in a support role providing mass and supporting wavering areas of line polybian system thumb by time of second punic war of late 3rd century bc this system had proved inefficient against enemies such as carthage after a series of more organic changes as opposed to a single intentional reform a new system gradually came into being infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth triarii being most experienced their equipment and role was very similar to previous system except they now carried scuta large rectangular shields that offered a greater degree of protection than old round number of triarii were reduced to 600 per legion forming 10 maniples of 60 men each triarii still made up third line in legion behind front line of hastati and second line of principes but rorarii and accensi were phased out leves had been replaced with velites who had a similar role but were also attached to principes and triarii pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion velites would gather at front and fling javelins to cover advance of hastati if hastati failed to break enemy they would fall back on principes who along with hastati had been re equipped with pila rather than spears if principes could not break enemy they would retire behind triarii who would then engage enemy this order of battle was almost always followed battle of great plains and battle of zama being among few notable exceptions at great plains scipio roman general formed his men up in usual manner but once hastati had begun to engage enemy he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force routing opposing carthaginians at zama scipio arranged his men into columns side by side with large lanes in between opposing carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on romans once surviving elephants had been routed scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in centre and hastati on flanks ready to engage carthaginian infantry marian reforms with formal military reforms of gaius marius in 107 bc implemented to combat a shortage of manpower due to wars against jugurtha in africa and germanic tribes to north different classes of units were scrapped entirely wealth and age requirements were removed after which anyone could join as a career rather than as service to city and all would be equipped as milites with same state purchased
