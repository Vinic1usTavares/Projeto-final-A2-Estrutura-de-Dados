inspired by anthologized french films with lots of short stories in them with all three short stories linked by a thematic desire to go away he further explained that peggy has this moment where she tries to be don and fails and then goes on peggy s version of don sexually irresponsible and drunk and working elisabeth moss said handjob peggy gives a stranger in theatre is a moment of forgetting after frustrating heinz pitch weiner spoke about structure of episode in june 2012 he spoke about writing of a scene of episode in august 2012 weiner characterized roger s acid trip as an experience of complete honesty and an experience of empathy something he s probably never experienced in his life he doesn t see world through other people s lives and that kind of epiphany to me is very beautiful even though it s end of relationship they are alone in truth together while discussing fight between don and megan weiner commented on violence and passion noting that what you get is that don loves this woman and that megan is everything that s good to him jessica pare commented on don s lack of respect for her work and jon hamm judged don s actions as immature however hamm regarded don s fear as genuine when he is unsure of megan s whereabouts flashback scene between don and megan in car was actually shot for fourth season finale tomorrowland written and directed by weiner but was cut weiner decided to this scene into episode as a flashback exterior scenes of howard johnson s hotel were filmed in october 2011 at regency inn and suites in baldwin park california hotel operated as a howard johnson s from 1967 until it was sold in 1995 editor christopher gay spoke about episode in august 2012 reception critical reception episode received overwhelmingly laudatory reviews from television critics particularly for its unusual departure from standard mad men episode structure and is considered to be one of best in series alan sepinwall of hitfix exalted episode and more formally experimental season admitting i m still not sure i understood 100 of it but i know i liked it a lot sepinwall characterized far away places as an episode that gave feel of dropping acid even when everyone on camera was stone sober matt weiner co writer semi chellas director scott hornbacher and actors combined to give us some of most memorable moments show has ever done emily vanderwerff of a v club gave it an a grade compared it to previous structurally daring episodes like seven twenty three and jet set and praised director for beautifully shot episode and gorgeous image of roger and jane lying heads touching on floor admitting their marriage just isn t working while noting that enemy of season is passage of time itself verne gay of newsday called it a good but difficult episode saying story lines were all parallel it was even an anthology with each story mirroring next bringing to mind that memorable scene when roger under influence is looking in mirror and told to look away themes of male female entanglement and disentangle and yes hair once again is a predominant metaphor themes of travel of being a stranger in a strange land of life on mars or in plattsburgh of alienation pursuit and of a generation born during holocaust amid holocaust tim goodman of hollywood reporter said lsd trip was handled brilliantly here with insight surprises unpredictability excellent humor and a really lovely smart ending and image of jane and roger on floor as an example of visual excellence of episode time magazine writer nate rawlings compared episode to a david lynch film and noted that all three stories also shared thematic connection of struggle between professional and work life ign reviewer eric goldman praised performances of john slattery and peyton list and said episode took three of show s best characters and rocked their worlds in very different ways telling three separate stories that were all utterly involving and moving and delivering one of show s best episodes ever in process this show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of roger friedman of forbes called lsd sequences with jane and roger to be so well written they were kind of transcendent salon writer nellie acclaimed episode while pointing out that with this episode s tilt of seesaw back to older generation from flailing youngsters we re reminded that while 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth like a drunk no historical change walks a straight line for all claims that don and others have made that kids increasingly hold cards real truth if we re telling it is that older white guys like bert and roger never truly lost power even if they began to hide behind scenes while fresh young faces took public glory ratings episode was
