images makes frequent use of geometric patterns which have developed over centuries geometric designs in islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles which may be overlapped and interlaced as can arabesques with which they are often combined to form intricate and complex patterns including a wide variety of tessellations these may constitute entire decoration may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments or may retreat into background around other motifs complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in ninth century through a variety of 6 to 13 point patterns by 13th century and finally to include also 14 and 16 point stars in sixteenth century geometric patterns occur in a variety of forms in islamic art and architecture including kilim carpets persian girih and moroccan zellige tilework muqarnas decorative vaulting jali pierced stone screens ceramics leather stained glass woodwork and metalwork interest in islamic geometric patterns is increasing in west both among craftsmen and artists including m c escher in twentieth century and among mathematicians and physicists including peter j lu and paul steinhardt who controversially claimed in 2007 that tilings at darb e imam shrine in isfahan could generate quasi periodic patterns like penrose tilings background islamic decoration islamic art mostly avoids figurative images to avoid becoming objects of worship this in islamic culture caused artists to explore non figural art and created a general aesthetic shift toward mathematically based decoration islamic geometric patterns derived from simpler designs used in earlier cultures greek roman and sasanian they are one of three forms of islamic decoration others being arabesque based on curving and branching plant forms and islamic calligraphy all three are frequently used together geometric designs and arabesques are forms of islamic interlace patterns purpose authors such as keith critchlow argue that islamic patterns are created to lead viewer to an understanding of underlying reality rather than being mere decoration as writers interested only in pattern sometimes imply in islamic culture patterns are believed to be bridge to spiritual realm instrument to purify mind and soul david wade states that much of art of islam whether in architecture ceramics textiles or books is art of decoration which is to say of transformation wade argues that aim is to turning mosques into lightness and pattern while decorated pages of a qur an can become windows onto infinite against this doris behrens states in her book beauty in arabic culture that a major difference between philosophical thinking of medieval europe and islamic world is exactly that concepts of good and beautiful are separated in arabic culture she argues that beauty whether in poetry or in visual arts was enjoyed for its own sake without commitment to religious or moral criteria pattern formation thumb shah vali shrine mahan iran 1431 blue girih tiled dome contains stars with from top 5 7 9 12 11 9 and 10 points in turn 11 point stars are rare in islamic art alt dome of shrine decorated with many different shapes of star many islamic designs are built on squares and circles typically repeated overlapped and interlaced to form intricate and complex patterns a recurring motif is 8 pointed star often seen in islamic tilework it is made of two squares one rotated 45 degrees with respect to other fourth basic shape is polygon including pentagons and octagons all of these can be combined and reworked to form complicated patterns with a variety of symmetries including reflections and rotations such patterns can be seen as mathematical tessellations which can extend indefinitely and thus suggest infinity they are constructed on grids that require only ruler and compass to draw artist and educator roman argues that such constructions are in effect algorithms making islamic geometric patterns forerunners of modern algorithmic art circle symbolizes unity and diversity in nature and many islamic patterns are drawn starting with a circle for example decoration of 15th century mosque in yazd persia is based on a circle divided into six by six circles drawn around it all touching at its centre and each touching its two neighbours centres to form a regular hexagon on this basis is constructed a six pointed star surrounded by six smaller irregular hexagons to form a tessellating star pattern this forms basic design which is outlined in white on wall of mosque that design however is overlaid with an intersecting tracery in blue around tiles of other colours forming an elaborate pattern that partially conceals original and underlying design a similar design forms logo of mohammed ali research center logo s construction is demonstrated in an animation on moha website one of early western students of islamic patterns ernest hanbury hankin defined a geometrical arabesque as a pattern formed with help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact he observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as residual spaces between polygons are reasonably symmetrical for example a grid of octagons in contact has squares of same side as octagons as residual spaces every octagon is basis for an 8 point star as seen at akbar s tomb sikandra 1605 1613 hankin considered skill of arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons almost astounding he further records that if a star occurs in a corner exactly one quarter of it should be shown if along an edge exactly one half of it topkapi scroll made in timurid dynasty iran in late 15th century or beginning of 16th

in islamic art were occasional isolated geometric shapes such as 8 pointed stars and lozenges containing squares these date from 836 in great mosque of kairouan tunisia and since then have spread all across islamic world middle stage thumb left upright middle stage patterns on geometric borders around a mihrab in alaeddin mosque konya turkey 1220 onwards alt middle stage islamic patterns next development marking middle stage of islamic geometric pattern usage was of 6 and 8 point stars which appear in 879 at ibn tulun mosque cairo and then became widespread a wider variety of patterns were used from 11th century abstract 6 and 8 point shapes appear in tower of at qazvin persia in 1067 and al juyushi mosque egypt in 1085 again becoming widespread from there though 6 point patterns are rare in turkey in 1086 7 and 10 point girih patterns with heptagons 5 and 6 pointed stars triangles and irregular hexagons appear in mosque of isfahan 10 point girih became widespread in islamic world except in spanish al andalus soon afterwards sweeping 9 11 and 13 point girih patterns were used in mosque also in persia in 1098 these like 7 point geometrical patterns are rarely used outside persia and central asia finally marking end of middle stage 8 and 12 point girih rosette patterns appear in alaeddin mosque at konya turkey in 1220 and in abbasid palace in baghdad in 1230 going on to become widespread across islamic world late stage thumb upright late stage geometric vegetal and calligraphic patterns around mihrab at jama masjid fatehpur sikri 1571 5 alt elaborate late stage islamic woodwork beginning of late stage is marked by use of simple 16 point patterns at hasan mausoleum in cairo in 1321 and in alhambra in spain in 1338 1390 these patterns are rarely found outside these two regions more elaborate combined 16 point geometrical patterns are found in sultan hasan complex in cairo in 1363 but rarely elsewhere finally 14 point patterns appear in jama masjid at fatehpur sikri in india in 1571 1596 but in few other places artforms several artforms in different parts of islamic world make use of geometric patterns these include ceramics girih strapwork jali pierced stone screens kilim rugs leather metalwork muqarnas vaulting stained glass woodwork and zellige tiling ceramics ceramics lend themselves to circular motifs whether radial or tangential bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes these may be partly figurative representing stylised leaves or flower petals while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug patterns of these types were employed on islamic ceramics from ayyubid period 13th century radially symmetric flowers with say 6 petals lend themselves to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs brightly coloured glazes and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery potters often chose patterns suited to shape of vessel they were making thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from aleppo in shape of a vertical circle with handles and neck above is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an arabic inscription with a small 8 petalled flower at centre girih tilings and woodwork girih are elaborate interlacing patterns formed of five standardized shapes style is used in persian islamic architecture and also in decorative woodwork girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork stucco and mosaic faience tilework in woodwork especially in safavid period it could be applied either as lattice frames left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings whether sacred or secular in architecture girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from 15th century to 20th century most designs are based on a partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points this is made into a pattern using 2 3 4 and 6 fold rotational symmetries which can fill plane visible pattern superimposed on grid is also geometric with 6 8 10 and 12 pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and under each other visible pattern does not coincide with underlying construction lines of tiling visible patterns and underlying tiling represent a bridge linking invisible to visible analogous to epistemological quest in islamic culture search for nature of knowledge jali thumb upright mosque of ibn tulun window with girih style 10

example in mughal dynasty buildings at fatehpur sikri and taj mahal geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5 and 8 pointed stars patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition jali functioned as windows or room dividers providing privacy but allowing in air and light jali forms a prominent element of architecture of india use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards and need for security modern simplified jali walls for example made with pre moulded clay or cement blocks have been popularised by architect laurie baker pierced windows in girih style are sometimes found elsewhere in islamic world such as in windows of mosque of ibn tulun in cairo kilim thumb upright somewhat geometric motifs such as wolf s mouth kurt agzi to protect flocks against wolves are often woven into tribal kilims a kilim is an islamic carpet without a pile whether for household use or a prayer mat pattern is made by winding weft threads back over warp threads when a colour boundary is reached this technique leaves a gap or vertical slit so kilims are sometimes called slit woven textiles kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2 or 4 fold mirror or rotational symmetries because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads curves are difficult to generate and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative for example wolf s mouth or wolf s foot motif turkish kurt agzi kurt expresses tribal weavers desires for protection of their families flocks from wolves leather islamic leather is often embossed with patterns similar to those already described leather book covers starting with quran where figurative artwork was excluded were decorated with a combination of kufic script medallions and geometric patterns typically bordered by geometric braiding metalwork metal artefacts share same geometric designs that are used in other forms of islamic art however in view of hamilton gibb emphasis differs geometric patterns tend to be used for borders and if they are in main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs arabesques animal motifs or calligraphic script geometric designs in islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs or they can form background pattern even where metal objects such as bowls and dishes do not seem to have geometric decoration still designs such as arabesques are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around object both closed designs which do not repeat and open or repetitive patterns are used patterns such as interlaced six pointed stars were especially popular from 12th century eva baer notes that while this design was essentially simple it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques sometimes organised around further basic islamic patterns such as hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles muqarnas muqarnas are elaborately carved ceilings to semi domes often used in mosques they are typically made of stucco and thus do not have a structural function but can also be of wood brick and stone they are characteristic of islamic architecture of middle ages from spain and morocco in west to persia in east architecturally they form multiple tiers of squinches diminishing in size as they rise they are often elaborately decorated stained glass geometrically patterned stained glass is used in a variety of settings in islamic architecture it is found in surviving summer residence of palace of khans azerbaijan

types back to italy from 14th century onwards dutch artist m c escher was inspired by alhambra s intricate decorative designs to study mathematics of tessellation transforming his style and influencing rest of his artistic career in his own words it was richest source of inspiration i have ever tapped which cites cultural organisations such as mathematical sciences research institute and

produce islamic geometric patterns effectively and economically craig s kaplan explains and illustrates in his ph d thesis how islamic star patterns can be generated algorithmically two physicists peter j lu and paul steinhardt attracted controversy in 2007 by claiming that girih designs such as that used on darb e imam shrine in isfahan were able to create quasi periodic tilings resembling those discovered by roger penrose in 1973 they showed that rather than traditional ruler and compass construction it was possible to create girih designs using a set of five girih tiles all

these are stable in either a contracted or an expanded state and can switch between two which might be useful for surgical stents or for spacecraft components when a conventional material is stretched along one axis it contracts along other axes at right angles to stretch but auxetic materials expand at right angles to pull internal structure that enables this unusual behaviour is inspired by two
