her erudite father s household showed a precocious aptitude for chinese classics and managed to acquire fluency she married in her mid to late twenties and gave birth to a daughter before her husband died two years after they were married it is uncertain when she began to write tale of genji but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed in about 1005 murasaki was invited to serve as a lady in waiting to empress shoshi at imperial court by fujiwara no michinaga probably because of her reputation as a writer she continued to write during her service adding scenes from court life to her work after five or six years she left court and retired with shoshi to lake biwa region scholars differ on year of her death although most agree on 1014 others have suggested she was alive in 1031 murasaki wrote diary of lady murasaki a volume of poetry and tale of genji within a decade of its completion genji was distributed throughout provinces within a century it was recognized as a classic of japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism early in 20th century her work was translated a six volume english translation was completed in

lost power and by time of murasaki s birth was at middle to lower ranks of heian aristocracy level of provincial governors shirane 1987 215 lower ranks of nobility were typically posted away from court to undesirable positions in provinces exiled from centralized power and court in kyoto despite loss of status family had a reputation among literati through murasaki s paternal great grandfather

collections of thirty six poets and yamato monogatari tales of yamato mulhern 1994 257 258 her great grandfather and grandfather both had been friendly with ki no who became notable for popularizing

was descended from same branch of northern fujiwara as tametoki couple had three children a son and two daughters in heian era use of names insofar as they were recorded did not follow a modern pattern a court lady as well as being known by title of her own position if any took a name referring to rank or title of a male relative thus shikibu is not a modern surname but refers to shikibu sho ministry of ceremonials where murasaki s father was a functionary murasaki an additional name possibly derived from color violet associated with wisteria meaning of word fuji an element of her clan name may have been bestowed on her at court in reference to name she herself had given to main female character in genji michinaga mentions names of several ladies in waiting in a 1007 diary entry one fujiwara no takako kyoshi may be murasaki s personal name seven women were named in entry with actual names of four women known of remaining three women one was not a fujiwara one held a high rank and therefore had to be older leaving possibility that third fujiwara no takako was murasaki see tsunoda 1963 1 27 in heian era japan husbands and wives kept separate households children were raised with their mothers although patrilineal system was still followed ueno 2009 254 murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father s household most likely on street in kyoto with her younger brother their mother died perhaps in childbirth when children were quite young murasaki had at least three half siblings raised with their mothers she was very close to one sister who died in her twenties shirane 1987 1983 50 michelle kyoto celebrates a 1000 year love affair december 31 2008 new york times retrieved august 9 2011 murasaki was born at a period when japan was becoming more isolated after missions to china had ended and a stronger national culture was emerging bowring 1996 xii in 9th and 10th centuries japanese gradually became a written language through development of kana a syllabary based on abbreviations of chinese characters in murasaki s lifetime men continued to write formally in chinese but kana became written language of intimacy and of noblewomen setting foundation for unique forms of japanese literature reischauer 1999 29 29 chinese was taught to murasaki s brother as preparation for a career in government and during her childhood living in her father s household she learned and became proficient in classical chinese in her diary she wrote when my brother was a young boy learning chinese classics i was in habit of listening to him and i became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize father a most learned man was always regretting fact just my luck he would say what a pity she was not born a man qtd in bowring 2004 11 12 with her brother she studied chinese literature and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music calligraphy and japanese poetry murasaki s education was unorthodox louis perez explains in history of japan that women were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in chinese perez 1998 21 murasaki was aware that others saw her as pretentious awkward difficult to approach prickly too fond of her tales haughty prone to disdainful cantankerous and scornful qtd in inge 1990 9 asian literature scholar thomas inge believes she had a forceful personality that seldom won her friends marriage aristocratic heian women lived restricted and secluded lives allowed to speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members murasaki s autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men unlike most noblewomen of her status she did not marry on reaching puberty instead she stayed in her father s household until her mid twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties knapp bettina lady murasaki s tale of genji symposium 1992 46 in 996 when her father was posted to a four year governorship in echizen province murasaki went with him although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of period to travel such a distance on a trip that could take as long as five days mulhern 1991 83 85 she returned to kyoto probably in 998 to marry her father s friend fujiwara no nobutaka c 950 c 1001 a much older second cousin descended from same branch of fujiwara clan he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at ministry of ceremonials with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer in his late forties at time of their marriage he had multiple households with an unknown number of wives and offspring gregarious and well known at court he was involved in numerous romantic relationships that may have continued after his marriage to murasaki as was customary she would have remained in her father s household where her husband would have visited her nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship and by time of his marriage to murasaki he was probably quite wealthy accounts of their marriage vary richard bowring writes that marriage was happy but japanese literature scholar haruo shirane sees indications in her poems that she resented her husband couple s daughter kenshi was born in 999 two years later nobutaka died during a cholera epidemic as a married woman murasaki would have had servants to run household and care for her daughter giving her ample leisure time she enjoyed reading and had access to romances monogatari such as tale of bamboo cutter and tales of ise scholars believe she may have started writing tale of genji before her husband s death it is known she was writing after she was widowed perhaps in a state of grief in her diary she describes her feelings after her husband s death i felt depressed and confused for some years i had existed from day to day in listless fashion doing little more than registering passage of time thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable qtd in mulhern 1991 84 according to legend murasaki retreated to ishiyama dera at lake biwa where she was inspired to write tale of genji on an august night while looking at moon although scholars dismiss factual basis of story of her retreat japanese artists often depicted her at ishiyama temple staring at moon for inspiration she may have been commissioned to write story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero prince genji murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of genji to friends who in turn would have re copied them and passed them on by this practice story became known and she gained a reputation as an author mulhern 1994 258 259 in her early to mid thirties she became a lady in waiting at court most likely because of her reputation as an author chieko mulhern writes in japanese women writers a biocritical sourcebook that scholars have wondered why murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with michinaga after her husband s death leading to speculation that two may have been lovers bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as michinaga s concubine although he did bring her to court without following official channels mulhern thinks michinaga wanted to have murasaki at court to educate his daughter shoshi bowring 2004 4 mulhern 1994 259 court life thumb left a tosa school mid to late 17th century yamato e

women wrote is recognized as some of earliest and among best literature written in japanese canon rival courts and women poets when in 995 michinaga s two brothers fujiwara no michitaka and fujiwara no died leaving regency vacant michinaga quickly won a power struggle against his nephew fujiwara no korechika brother to teishi emperor ichijo s wife and aided by his sister senshi he assumed power teishi had supported her brother korechika who was discredited and banished from court in 996 following a scandal involving his shooting at retired emperor kazan causing her to lose power shively and mccullough 1999 67 69 four years later michinaga sent shoshi his eldest daughter to emperor ichijo s harem when she was about 12 mccullough 1990 201 a year after placing shoshi in imperial harem in an effort to undermine teishi s influence and increase shoshi s standing michinaga had her named empress although teishi already held title as historian donald shively explains michinaga shocked even his admirers by arranging for unprecedented appointment of teishi or sadako and shoshi as concurrent empresses of same emperor teishi holding usual title of lustrous heir bearer kogo and shoshi that of inner palatine a derived equivalent coined for occasion about five years later michinaga brought murasaki to shoshi s court in a position that bowring describes as a companion tutor bowring 1996 xiv women of high status lived in seclusion at court and through strategic marriages were used to gain political power for their families in case of shoshi and other such marriages to members of imperial clan it enabled woman s clan to exercise influence over emperor this was how michinaga and other fujiwara regents achieved their power despite their seclusion some women wielded considerable influence often achieved through competitive salons dependent on quality of those attending bowring 1996 xv xvii ichijo s mother and michinaga s sister senshi had an influential salon and michinaga probably wanted shoshi to surround herself with skilled women such as murasaki to build a rival salon shoshi was 16 to 19 when murasaki joined her court according to mulhern shoshi was 19 when murasaki arrived waley states she was 16 see mulhern 1994 259 and waley 1960 vii according to arthur waley shoshi was a serious minded young lady whose living arrangements were divided between her father s household and her court at imperial palace waley 1960 vii she gathered around her talented women writers such as izumi shikibu and emon author of an early vernacular history tale of flowering fortunes mulhern 1994 156 rivalry that existed among women is evident in murasaki s diary where she wrote disparagingly of izumi izumi shikibu is an amusing letter writer but there is something not very satisfactory about her she has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running hand but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate indeed it does not seem to me that in herself she is really a poet at all waley 1960 xii sei shonagon author of pillow book had been in service as lady in waiting to teishi when shoshi came to court it is possible that murasaki was invited to shoshi s court as a rival to shonagon teishi died in 1001 before murasaki entered service with shoshi so two writers were not there concurrently but murasaki who wrote about shonagon in her diary certainly knew of her and to an extent was influenced by her keene 1999 414 415 shonagon s pillow book may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight teishi s court known for its educated ladies in waiting japanese literature scholar joshua mostow believes michinaga provided murasaki to shoshi as an equally or better educated woman so as to showcase shoshi s court in a similar manner mostow 2001 130 two writers had different temperaments shonagon was witty clever and outspoken murasaki was withdrawn and sensitive entries in murasaki s diary show that two may not have been on good terms murasaki wrote sei shonagon was dreadfully conceited she thought herself so clever littered her writing with chinese characters which left a great deal to be desired qtd in keene 1999 414 keene thinks that murasaki s impression of shonagon could have been influenced by shoshi and women at her court because shonagon served shoshi s rival empress furthermore he believes murasaki was brought to court to write genji in response to shonagon s popular pillow book murasaki contrasted herself to shonagon in a variety of ways she denigrated pillow book genre and unlike shonagon who flaunted her knowledge of chinese murasaki pretended to not know language regarding it as pretentious and affected lady of chronicles although popularity of chinese language diminished in late heian era chinese ballads continued to be popular including those written by bai juyi murasaki taught chinese to shoshi who was interested in chinese art and juyi s ballads upon becoming empress shoshi installed screens decorated with chinese script causing outrage because written chinese was considered language of men far removed from women s quarters adolphson 2007 110 119 study of chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against notion that only men should have access to literature women were supposed to read and write only in japanese which separated them through language from government and power structure murasaki with her unconventional classical chinese education was one of few women available to teach shoshi classical chinese adolphson 2007 110 bowring writes it was almost subversive that murasaki knew chinese and taught language to shoshi bowring 2004 11 murasaki who was reticent about her chinese education held lessons between two women in secret writing in her diary since last summer very secretly in odd moments when there happened to be no one about i have been reading with her majesty there has of course been no question of formal lessons i have thought it best to say nothing about matter to anybody qtd in waley 1960 ix x murasaki probably earned an ambiguous nickname lady of chronicles nihongi no tsubone for teaching shoshi chinese literature a lady in waiting who disliked murasaki accused her of flaunting her knowledge of chinese and began calling her lady of chronicles an allusion to classic chronicles of japan after an incident in which chapters from genji were read aloud to emperor and his courtiers one of whom remarked that author showed a high level of education murasaki wrote in her diary how utterly ridiculous would i who hesitate to reveal my learning to my women at home ever think of doing so at court qtd in mostow 2001 133 although nickname was apparently meant to be disparaging mulhern believes murasaki was flattered by it attitude toward chinese language was contradictory in teishi s court chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority yet in shoshi s salon there was a great deal of hostility towards language perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when chinese began to be rejected in favor of japanese even though shoshi herself was a student of language hostility may have affected murasaki and her opinion of court and forced her to hide her knowledge of chinese unlike shonagon who was both ostentatious and flirtatious as well as outspoken about her knowledge of chinese murasaki seems to have been humble an attitude which possibly impressed michinaga although murasaki used chinese and incorporated it in her writing she publicly rejected language a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning japanese culture mostow 2001 131 137 murasaki seems to have been unhappy with court life and was withdrawn and somber no surviving records show that she entered poetry competitions she appears to have exchanged few poems or letters with other women during her service in general unlike sei shonagon murasaki gives impression in her diary that she disliked court life other ladies in waiting and drunken revelry she did however become close friends with a lady in waiting named lady and she wrote of winters that she enjoyed i love to see snow here waley 1960 1960 xi according to waley murasaki may not have been unhappy with court life in general but bored in shoshi s court he speculates she would have preferred to serve with lady senshi whose household seems to have been less strict and more light hearted in her diary murasaki wrote about shoshi s court she has gathered round her a number of very worthy young ladies her majesty is beginning to acquire more experience of life and no longer judges others by same rigid standards as before but meanwhile her court has gained a reputation for extreme dullness waley 1960 viii thumb in this 13th century painting from murasaki shikibu diary emaki drunk and disordered heian courtiers are shown joking and flirting with court ladies murasaki disliked men at court whom she thought to be drunken and stupid however some scholars such as waley are certain she was involved romantically with michinaga at least michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010 yet she wrote to him in a poem you have neither read my book nor won my love waley 1960 x in her diary she records having to avoid advances from michinaga one night he sneaked into her room stealing a newly written chapter of genji mulhern 1994 260 261 however michinaga s patronage was essential if she was to continue writing shirane 1987 221 222 murasaki described her daughter s court activities lavish ceremonies complicated courtships complexities of marriage system and in elaborate detail birth of shoshi s two sons it is likely that murasaki enjoyed writing in solitude she believed she did not fit well with general atmosphere of court writing of herself i am wrapped up in study of ancient stories living all time in a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing existence of other people but when they get to know me they find to their extreme surprise that i am kind and gentle waley 1960 xv inge says that she was too outspoken to make friends at court and mulhern thinks murasaki s court life was comparatively quiet compared to other court poets mulhern speculates that her remarks about izumi were not so much directed at izumi s poetry but at her behavior lack of morality and her court liaisons of which murasaki disapproved rank was important in heian court society and murasaki would not have felt herself to have much if anything in common with higher ranked and more powerful bowring 2004 3 in her diary she wrote of her life at court i realized that my branch of family was a very humble one but thought seldom troubled me and i was in those days far indeed from painful consciousness of inferiority which makes life at court a continual torment to me waley 1960 xiv a court position would have increased her social standing but more importantly she gained a greater experience to write about court life as she experienced it is well reflected in chapters of genji written after she joined shoshi name murasaki was most probably given to her at a court dinner in an incident she recorded in her diary in c 1008 well known court poet fujiwara no inquired after young murasaki an allusion to character named murasaki in genji which would have been considered a compliment from a male court poet to a female author later life and death thumb genji garden at a temple in kyoto associated with her former mansion when emperor ichijo died in 1011 shoshi retired from imperial palace to live in a fujiwara mansion in biwa most likely accompanied by murasaki who is recorded as being there with shoshi in 1013 george aston explains that when murasaki retired from court she was again associated with ishiyama dera to this beautiful spot it is said murasaki no shikibu sic retired from court life to devote remainder of her days to literature and religion there are sceptics however being one who refuse to believe this story pointing out that it is irreconcilable with known facts on other hand very chamber in temple where genji was written is shown with ink slab which author used and a buddhist sutra in her handwriting which if they do not satisfy critic still are sufficient to carry conviction to minds of ordinary visitors to temple aston 1899 93 murasaki may have died in 1014 her father made a hasty return to kyoto from his post at echigo province that year possibly because of her death writing in a bridge of dreams a poetics of tale of genji shirane mentions that 1014 is generally accepted as date of murasaki shikibu s death and 973 as date of her birth making her 41 when she died bowring considers 1014 to be speculative and believes she may have lived with shoshi until as late as 1025 bowring 2004 5 waley agrees given that murasaki may have attended ceremonies with shoshi held for her son emperor go ichijo around 1025 murasaki s brother died in around 1011 which combined with death of his daughter may have prompted her father to resign his post and take vows at temple where he died in 1029 murasaki s daughter entered court service in 1025 as a wet nurse to future emperor go reizei 1025 1068 she went on to become a well known poet as no mulhern 1996 259 works thumb

murasaki tale of genji diary of lady murasaki and poetic memoirs a collection of 128 poems her work is considered important because her writing reflects creation and development of japanese writing during a period when japanese shifted from an unwritten vernacular to a written language until 9th century japanese language texts were written in chinese characters using man writing system mason 1997 81 a revolutionary achievement was development of kana a true japanese script in mid to late 9th century japanese authors began to write prose in their own language which led to genres such as tales monogatari and poetic journals nikki kodansha international 2004 475 2008b 2 113 2005 594 historian edwin reischauer writes that genres such as monogatari were distinctly japanese and that genji written in kana was outstanding work of period diary and poetry thumb 13th century emakimono illustration of diary of lady murasaki showing empress shoshi with infant emperor go ichijo and ladies in waiting secluded behind a murasaki began her diary after she entered service at shoshi s court much of what we know about her and her experiences at court comes from diary which covers period from about 1008 to 1010 long descriptive passages some of which may have originated as letters cover her relationships with other ladies in waiting michinaga s temperament birth of shoshi s sons at michinaga s mansion rather than at imperial palace and process of writing genji including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions mccullough 1990 16 typical

original set has been lost according to custom verses would have been passed from person to person and often copied some appear written for a lover possibly her husband before he died but she may have merely followed tradition and written simple love poems they contain biographical details she mentions a sister who died visit to echizen province with her father and that she wrote poetry for shoshi murasaki s poems were published in 1206 by fujiwara no teika in what mulhern believes to be collection that is closest to original form at around same time teika included a selection of murasaki s works in an imperial anthology new collections of ancient and modern times tale of genji murasaki is best known for her tale of genji a three part novel spanning 1100 pages and 54 chapters mulhern

continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to shoshi shively 1999 445 she would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length michinaga provided her with

japanese fiction by drawing on traditions of waka court diaries and earlier monogatari written in a mixture of chinese script and japanese script such as tale of bamboo cutter or tales of ise keene 1988 75 79 81 84 she drew on and blended styles from chinese histories narrative poetry and contemporary japanese prose adolphson writes that juxtaposition of formal chinese style with mundane subjects resulted in a sense of parody or satire giving her a distinctive voice adolphson 2007 121 122 genji follows traditional format of monogatari telling a tale particularly evident in its use of a narrator but keene claims murasaki developed genre far beyond its bounds and by doing so created a form that is utterly modern story of shining prince genji is set in late 9th to early 10th centuries and murasaki eliminated from it elements of fairy tales and fantasy frequently found in earlier monogatari keene 1988 81 84 themes in genji are common to period and are defined by shively as encapsulating tyranny of time and inescapable sorrow of romantic love shively 1990 444 main theme is that of fragility of life sorrow of human existence mono no aware she used term over a thousand times in genji henshall 1999 27 keene speculates that in her tale of shining prince murasaki may have created for herself an idealistic escape from court life which she found less than savory in prince genji she formed a gifted comely refined yet human and sympathetic protagonist keene writes that genji gives a view into heian period for example love affairs flourished although women typically remained unseen behind screens curtains or fusuma helen mccullough describes murasaki s writing as of universal appeal and believes tale of genji transcends both its genre and age its basic subject matter and setting love at heian court are those of romance and its cultural assumptions are those of mid heian period but murasaki shikibu s unique genius has made work for many a powerful statement of human relationships impossibility of permanent happiness in love and vital importance in a world of sorrows of sensitivity to feelings of others mccullough 1999 9 prince genji recognizes in each of his lovers inner beauty of woman and fragility of life which according to keene makes him heroic story was popular emperor ichijo had it read to him even though it was written in japanese by 1021 all chapters were known to be complete and work was sought after in provinces where it was scarce bowring 2004 79 legacy murasaki s reputation and influence have not diminished since her lifetime when she with other heian women writers was instrumental in developing japanese into a written language bowring 2004 12 her writing was required reading for court poets as early as 12th century as her work began to be studied by scholars who generated authoritative versions and criticism within a century of her death she was highly regarded as a classical writer in 17th century murasaki s work became emblematic of confucian philosophy and women were encouraged to read her books in 1673 kumazawa banzan argued that her writing was valuable for its sensitivity and depiction of emotions he wrote in his discursive commentary on genji that when human feelings are not understood harmony of five human relationships is lost qtd in lillehoj 2007 110 tale of genji was copied and
