a short history of progress is a non fiction book and lecture series by ronald wright about societal collapse lectures were delivered as a series of five speeches each taking place in different cities across canada as part of 2004 massey lectures which were broadcast on cbc radio program ideas book version was published by house of anansi press and released at same time as lectures book spent more than a year on canadian best seller lists won canadian book association s libris award for non fiction book of year and was nominated for british columbia s national award for canadian non fiction it has since been reprinted in a hardcover format with illustrations and also in kindle and epub digital formats wright an author of fiction and non fiction works uses fallen civilisations of easter island sumer rome and maya as well as examples from stone age to see what conditions led to downfall of those societies he examines meaning of progress and its implications for civilizations past and present arguing that twentieth century was a time of runaway growth in human population consumption and technology that has now placed an unsustainable burden on all natural systems in his analysis of four cases of fallen civilizations he notes that two easter island and sumer failed due to depletion of natural resources their ecologies were unable to regenerate other two failed in their heartlands where ecological demand was highest but left remnant populations that survived he asks question why if civilizations so often destroy themselves has overall experiment of civilization done so well for answer he says we must look to natural regeneration and human migration while some ancient civilizations were depleting their ecologies and failing others were rising large expanses of planet were unsettled other factor evident in both egypt and china was that due to abundant resources e g topsoil farming methods ones that worked with rather than against natural cycles and settlement patterns these civilizations had greater longevity changes brought on by exponential growth of human population at time of book s publication over six billion and adding more than 200 million people every three years and worldwide scale of resource consumption have altered picture however ecological markers indicate that human civilization has now surpassed since 1980s nature s capacity for regeneration we are now using more than 125 percent of nature s yearly output if civilization is to survive it must live on interest not capital of nature he concludes that now is our chance to get future right collapse of human civilization is imminent if we do not act now to prevent it background prior to being selected to deliver massey lectures wright had written award winning fiction and non fiction books that deal with anthropology and civilizations his 1992 non fiction book stolen continents new world through indian eyes was awarded 1993 gordon award from writers trust of canada and his 1998 novel a scientific romance about a museum curator who travels into future and investigates fate of human race won david higham prize for fiction for first time novelists wright traces origins of ideas behind a short history of progress to material he studied while writing a scientific romance and his 2000 essay for globe and mail titled civilization is a pyramid scheme about fall of ninth century mayan civilisation synopsis first chapter gauguin s questions poses questions that provide a framework for book referring to paul gauguin s painting of same name questions are where do we come from what are we where are we going wright defines progress using victorian terms assumption that a pattern of change exists in history of mankind that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only and that this direction is towards improvement despite extended time span of stone age wright places first sign of progress as being ability to create fire competition between cro magnon and neanderthals is examined with respect to conditions that allowed one to out compete other second chapter great experiment continues examination of stone age progress by looking at advancements in hunting wright uses term progress trap to refer to innovations that create new problems for which society is unable or unwilling to solve or inadvertently create conditions that are worse than what existed before innovation for example innovations in hunting during stone age allowed for more successful hunts and consequently more free time during which culture and art were created e g cave paintings bone carvings etc but also led to extinctions most notably of megafauna as smaller and smaller game were hunted to replace larger extinct animals hunts became less successful and culture declined agriculture and subsequently civilisations independently arising in multiple regions at about same time about 10 000 years ago indicates to wright that given certain broad conditions human societies everywhere will move towards greater size complexity and environmental demand chapter title refers to human experience which wright sees as a large experiment testing what conditions are required for a human civilisation to succeed in third chapter fools paradise rise and fall of two civilisations are examined easter island and sumer both flourished but collapsed as a result of resource depletion both were able to visually see their land being eroded but were unwilling to reform on easter island logging in order to erect statues and build boats destroyed their ecosystem and led to wars over last planks of wood on island in sumer a large irrigation system as well as over grazing land clearing and lime burning led to desertification and soil salination in fourth chapter pyramid schemes fates of roman and mayan civilisations are compared both peaked with centralised empires but ended with power being diffused to their periphery as center collapsed and ultra conservative leadership refused reformations anthropologist joseph tainter s explanation for fall of roman empire is invoked that complex systems inevitably succumb to diminishing returns so that costs of operating an empire are so high that alternatives are implemented two examples of civilisations that have been sustainable are described china and egypt both had an abundance of resources particularly topsoil and used farming methods that worked with rather than against natural cycles and settlement patterns that did not exceed or permanently damage carrying capacity of local environment final chapter rebellion of tools seeks to answer final gauguin question where are we going by applying these past examples to modern society wright sees needed reforms being blocked by vested interests who reject multi lateral organisations and support laissez faire economics and transfers of power to corporations as leading to social and environmental degradations that led to collapse of previous civilisations necessary reforms are in wright s view being blocked by vested interests who are hostile to change including american market extremists wright concludes that our present behaviour is typical of failed societies at zenith of their greed and arrogance and calls for a shift towards long term thinking style contents of book were originally written and delivered as a set of five speeches for 2004 massey lectures each speech is presented in book as one chapter writing reflects wright oration style with use of high rhetoric patrick notes that wright sometimes uses rhetorical armoury of a rationalistic lay preacher wright takes a broad philosophical approach not focusing on individual people or specific politics or religions but rather focusing on civilisations including elites and masses wright s tone was described as rarely depressing and that he remains surprisingly upbeat and even entertaining use of word progress is intended to be ironic what is viewed as technological or social advancement have in historical narratives he provides led to fall of civilizations wright coins term progress trap to describe phenomenon of turning cleverness into recklessness comparisons have been made between this book and jared diamond s collapse how societies choose to fail or succeed which both cover similar subject matter with a cautious problem solving approach and come to similar conclusions writing in alternatives journal philosophy professor kent peacock notes that both are well written but that diamond includes examples of societies which had achieved sustainability for centuries whereas wright has a stronger grasp of dark side of human nature like impatience aggressiveness and obstinacy author and journalist brian brett described collapse as a slow rich feast while compact a short history of progress is an arrow loosed from a powerful bow a lyric dart into heart of human behaviour publication and reception book published by house of anansi press was released at same time massey lectures were being delivered in early november 2004 one lecture was given by wright in each of following cities ottawa edmonton saskatoon halifax and

short listed for first annual british columbia award for canadian non fiction a hardcover edition title an illustrated short history of progress was released with a print run of 15 000 copies in 2006 in globe and mail canadian author paul william roberts praised book calling it most important use of printed word and post consumer recycled fibres i have seen since jerome s promethee 25 years ago roberts explains wright has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous you feel you ve read volumes though not just because of density of wright s thoughts but due to crushing weight of burden they carry in prose that is evocative and precise on other hand in national post review peter foster gave a negative review chiding wright for not having slightest clue about how economies work or how by their fundamental nature markets are both moral and sustainable foster ended his review by insulting wright s intellect what really needs some psychological excavation is ronald wright s mind which carries a set of inflated emotionally based moralistic assumptions derived from structure of his primitive ignorance about markets and economics other reviews were encouraging in maclean s magazine brian bethune wrote it was an elegant and learned discussion on topic review in times said it was an eminently readable account written with an incredible lightness of touch that belies very serious issues in montreal gazette bryan called wright eloquent and book a brief trenchant essay diane in skeptic magazine said wright is a remarkably gifted wordsmith whose talent makes turgid facts not only digestible but also generates a hunger for more and commented a short history of progress is an important well crafted book however i can t promise that it will
