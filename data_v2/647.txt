on 21 january 1968 an aircraft accident sometimes known as thule affair or thule accident involving a united states air force usaf b 52 bomber occurred near thule air base in danish territory of greenland aircraft was carrying four b28fi thermonuclear bombs on a cold war chrome dome alert mission over baffin bay when a cabin fire forced crew to abandon aircraft before they could carry out an emergency landing at thule air base six crew members ejected safely but one who did not have an ejection seat was killed while trying to bail out bomber crashed onto sea ice in north star bay greenland causing conventional explosives aboard to detonate and nuclear payload to rupture and disperse which resulted in radioactive contamination united states and denmark launched an intensive clean up and recovery operation but secondary stage of one of nuclear weapons could not be accounted for after operation was completed usaf strategic air command chrome dome operations were discontinued immediately after accident which highlighted safety and political risks of missions safety procedures were reviewed and more stable explosives were developed for use in nuclear weapons in 1995 a political scandal arose in denmark after a report revealed government had given tacit permission for nuclear weapons to be located in greenland in contravention of denmark s 1957 nuclear free zone policy workers involved in clean up program have been campaigning for compensation for radiation related illnesses they experienced in years after accident thule monitor mission thumb left 250px

strategic air command sac began operation chrome dome a cold war airborne alert program devised by general thomas s power to fly nuclear armed boeing b 52 stratofortress bombers to borders of soviet union flights were scheduled to ensure that twelve bombers were aloft at all times these bombers gave sac offensive capability in event of a soviet first strike and provided a significant cold war nuclear deterrent beginning in 1961 b 52 bombers also secretly flew as part of hard head mission or thule monitor missions over thule air base objective of hard head was to maintain constant visual surveillance of base s strategically important ballistic missile early warning system bmews which provided early warning of soviet missile launches if communication link between north american aerospace defense command and base was severed aircraft crew could determine if interruption resulted from an attack or a technical failure monitoring mission started when designated aircraft reached a waypoint at in baffin bay and entered a figure eight holding pattern above air base at an altitude of in 1966 united states secretary of defense robert mcnamara proposed cutting chrome dome flights because bmews system was fully operational bombers had been made redundant by missiles and 123 million as of could be saved sac and joint chiefs of staff opposed plan so a compromise was reached whereby a smaller force of four bombers would be on alert each day despite reduced program and risks highlighted by 1966 palomares b 52 crash sac continued to dedicate one of aircraft to monitoring thule air base this assignment was without knowledge of civilian authorities in united states who sac determined did not have need to know about specific operational points broken arrow on 21 january 1968 a b 52g stratofortress serial number 58 0188 with callsign hobo 28 from 380th strategic bomb wing at plattsburgh air force base new york was assigned hard head mission over thule and nearby baffin bay bomber crew consisted of five regular crew members including captain john haug aircraft commander also aboard were a substitute navigator captain curtis r criss and a mandatory third pilot major alfred d mario before take off d mario placed three cloth covered foam cushions on top of a heating vent under instructor navigator s seat in aft section of lower deck shortly after take off another cushion was placed under seat flight was uneventful until scheduled mid air refueling from a kc 135 stratotanker which had to be conducted manually because of an error with b 52g s autopilot about one hour after refueling while aircraft was circling above its designated area captain haug directed co pilot svitenko to take his rest period his seat was taken by spare pilot d mario crew was uncomfortable because of cold although heater s was turned up so d mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into heater from engine manifold because of a heater malfunction air barely cooled as it traveled from engine manifold to cabin s heating ducts during next half hour cabin s temperature became uncomfortably hot and stowed cushions ignited after one crew member reported smelling burning rubber they looked for a fire navigator searched lower compartment twice before discovering fire behind a metal box he attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers but could not put it out thumb left thule air base in foreground with north star bay which was covered in sea ice at time of accident in background alt aerial photograph of thule air base with north star bay in background land masses are show covered in snow but bay is not frozen over at 15 22 est about six hours into flight and south of thule air base haug declared an emergency he told thule air traffic

smoke filled cockpit to point that pilots could not read their instruments aec observers interim report of thule accident 1968 as situation worsened captain realized he would not be able to land aircraft and told crew to prepare to abandon it they awaited word from d mario that they were over land and when he confirmed that aircraft was directly over lights of thule air base four crewmen ejected followed shortly thereafter by haug and d mario co pilot leonard svitenko who had given up his ejection seat when spare pilot took over from him sustained fatal head injuries when he attempted to bail out through one of lower hatches pilotless aircraft initially continued north then turned left through 180deg and crashed onto sea ice in north star bay at a relatively shallow angle of 20 degrees about west of thule air base at 15 39 est conventional high explosive he components of four 1 1 megaton b28fi thermonuclear bombs detonated on impact spreading radioactive material over a

at least six crew ejected successfully and aircraft was carrying four nuclear weapons off duty staff were mustered to conduct search and rescue operations for remaining crew members owing to extreme weather conditions arctic darkness and unnavigable ice base relied largely on thule representative of royal greenland trade department ministry of greenland jens zinglersen to raise and mount search using native dog sled teams three of survivors landed within of base and were rescued within two hours for his initial actions and later services zinglersen received air force exceptional civilian service medal on 26 february 1968 at hands of u s ambassador k e white captain criss who was first to eject landed from base he remained lost on an ice floe for 21 hours and suffered hypothermia in

american and danish officials immediately launched project crested ice informally known as dr a clean up operation to remove debris and contain environmental damage despite cold dark arctic winter there was considerable pressure to complete clean up operation before sea ice melted in spring and deposited further contaminants into sea thumb left camp hunziker was set up at accident site weather conditions at site were extreme average temperature was at times dropping to these temperatures were accompanied by winds of up to equipment suffered high failure rates and batteries worked for shorter periods in cold operators modified their scientific instruments to allow battery packs to be carried under their coats to extend batteries lifespan operation was conducted in arctic darkness until 14 february when sunlight gradually began appearing a base camp named camp hunziker after richard overton hunziker usaf general in charge of operation was created at crash site it included a heliport igloos generators and communications facilities a zero line delineating by area in which alpha particle contamination could be measured was established by 25 january four days after crash line was subsequently used to control decontamination of personnel and vehicles an ice road was constructed to thule from site this was followed by a second more direct road so that ice on first road was not fatigued by overuse camp later included a large prefabricated building two ski mounted buildings several huts a decontamination trailer and a latrine these facilities allowed for 24 hour operations at crash site thumb contaminated ice being loaded into steel tanks at thule during project crested ice alt a crane shown loading contaminated ice into a large steel tank usaf worked with danish nuclear scientists to consider clean up options spilled fuel in blackened area was heavily contaminated raising concerns that when ice melted in summer radioactive fuel would float on sea and subsequently contaminate shore danes thus insisted on removal of blackened area to avoid this possibility danes also requested that nuclear material not be left in greenland after cleanup operation was complete therefore requiring general hunziker to remove contaminated ice and wreckage to united states for disposal usaf personnel used graders to collect contaminated snow and ice which was loaded into wooden boxes at crash site boxes were moved to a holding area near thule air base known as tank farm there contaminated material was loaded into steel tanks prior to being loaded onto ships debris from weapons was sent to pantex plant in texas for evaluation and tanks were shipped to savannah river in south carolina according to general hunziker 93 percent of contaminated material was removed from accident site in 1987 88 and again in 2000 reports surfaced in danish press that one of bombs had not been recovered sac stated at time of accident that all four bombs were destroyed in 2008 bbc published an article that was based on its examination of partly declassified documents obtained some years earlier via united states freedom of information act documents appeared to confirm that within weeks of accident investigators realized only three of weapons could be accounted for one of declassified documents dated to january 1968 details a blackened section of ice which had with shroud lines from a weapon parachute speculate something melted through ice such as burning primary or secondary a july 1968 report states an analysis by aec of recovered secondary components indicates recovery of 85 percent of uranium and 94 percent by weight of three secondaries no parts of fourth secondary have been identified usaf nuclear safety p 4 bbc tracked down several officials involved in accident s aftermath one was william h chambers a former nuclear weapons designer at los alamos national laboratory chambers headed a team dealing with nuclear accidents including thule crash he explained logic behind decision to abandon search there was disappointment in what you might call a failure to return all of components it would be very difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we couldn t find them thumb left set of four b28fi thermonuclear bombs of same type as those in accident at thule alt four silver b28fi nuclear bombs in a rack ready for loading into an aircraft in august 1968 united states military sent a star iii mini submarine to base to look for weapon debris especially uranium 235 fissile core of a secondary a much bigger operation at palomares off coast of spain two years earlier led to recovery of a lost nuclear weapon from mediterranean sea b28fi bomb was lost for 80 days after a mid air collision between a b 52 on a chrome dome mission and its kc 135 stratotanker refueling aircraft usaf nuclear safety 1966 christensen asserts that purpose of underwater search at thule was obvious to danish authorities contrary to other reports that suggested its true purpose had been hidden from them at lower levels however dives were surrounded by some confidentiality one document from july 1968 reads fact that this operation includes search for object or missing weapon part is to be treated as confidential meaning it was not to be disclosed to non us nationals it continues for discussion with danes this operation should be referred to as a survey repeat survey of bottom under impact point further indications of search are apparent in a september 1968 interim report by united states atomic energy commission which stated it was further speculated that missing redacted in view of its ballistic characteristics may have come to rest beyond observed concentration of heavy debris this discussion was a reference to unsuccessful search for uranium cylinder of one of secondaries underwater search was beset by technical problems and eventually abandoned diagrams and notes included in declassified documents make clear it was not possible to search entire area where crash debris had spread four bomb reservoirs one nearly intact secondary and parts equaling two secondaries were recovered on sea ice parts equaling one secondary were not accounted for usaf nuclear safety 1968 search also revealed a weapon cable fairing polar cap and a one foot by three foot section of a warhead s ballistic case united states air force monitored airborne contamination through nasal swabs of onsite personnel of 9 837 nasal swabs taken 335 samples had detectable levels of alpha particle activity although none were above acceptable levels urinalysis was also performed but none of 756 samples displayed any detectable level of plutonium thumb star iii submersible used in underwater search for missing bomb components alt star iii submersible on display outside scripps institution of oceanography white vessel has appearance of short fat cigar by time operation concluded 700 specialized personnel from both countries and more than 70 united states government agencies had worked for nine months to clean up site often without adequate protective clothing or decontamination measures in total more than of contaminated liquid along with thirty tanks of miscellaneous material some of it contaminated were collected at tank farm project crested ice ended on 13 september 1968 when last tank was loaded onto a ship bound for united states operation is estimated to have cost 9 4 million as of aftermath operation chrome dome accident caused controversy at time and in years since it highlighted risks thule air base posed to from nuclear accidents and potential superpower conflicts accident which occurred two years after palomares crash signaled immediate end of airborne alert program which had become untenable because of political and operational risks involved scott sagan a political science academic and anti nuclear writer postulated that if hobo 28 monitoring aircraft had crashed into bmews early warning array instead of baffin bay it would have presented norad with a scenario radio link to hard head aircraft and bmews both dead no nuclear detonation detected that also matched that of a surprise conventional missile attack on thule leaving unreliable submarine telecommunications cable between thule and us mainland as only source of information to contrary a satellite communications link was set up in 1974 according to greenpeace united states and ussr were concerned enough by accidents such as 1961 goldsboro b 52 crash 1966 palomares b 52 crash and thule accident that they agreed to take measures to ensure that a future nuclear accident would not lead other party to conclude incorrectly that a first strike was under way consequently on 30 september 1971 two superpowers signed agreement on measures to reduce risk of nuclear war each party agreed to notify other immediately in event of an accidental unauthorized or unexplained incident involving a nuclear weapon that could increase risk of nuclear war they agreed to use moscow washington hotline which was upgraded at same time for any communications decision not to restart on alert bomber missions was also a reflection of strategic decline of manned nuclear weapon delivery in favor of unmanned delivery via icbms which had already eclipsed number of bombers in united states by april 1964 weapon safety following palomares and thule accidents only cases where conventional explosives of u s nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials investigators concluded high explosive he used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand forces involved in an aircraft accident they also determined that electrical circuits of weapons safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit findings triggered research by scientists in united states into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons lawrence livermore national laboratory developed susan test which uses a special projectile whose design simulates an aircraft accident by squeezing and nipping explosive material between its metal surfaces test projectile is fired under controlled conditions at a hard surface to measure reactions and thresholds of different explosives to an impact by 1979 los alamos national laboratory developed a new safer type of explosive called insensitive high explosive ihe for use in u s nuclear weapons physicist and nuclear weapons designer ray kidder speculated that weapons in palomares and thule accidents would probably not have detonated had ihe been available at time thulegate political scandal denmark s nuclear free zone policy originated in 1957 when coalition government decided in lead up to paris nato summit not to stockpile nuclear weapons on its soil in peacetime presence of bomber in greenland airspace in 1968 therefore triggered public suspicions and accusations that policy was being violated nature of hard head missions was suppressed at time of accident us state department via nautilus org 1968 danish and american governments instead claimed bomber was not on a routine mission over greenland and that it diverted there because of a one off emergency united states documents declassified in 1990s contradicted danish government s position and therefore resulted in a 1995 political scandal that press dubbed thulegate danish parliament commissioned a report from danish institute of international affairs dupi to determine history of united states nuclear overflights of greenland and role of thule air base in this regard when two volume work was published on 17 january 1997 it confirmed that nuclear armed flights over greenland were recurrent but that united states had acted in good faith report blamed danish prime minister h c hansen for intentionally introducing ambiguity in danish u s security agreement he was not asked about nor did he mention official danish nuclear policy when meeting with united states ambassador in 1957 to discuss thule air base hansen followed up discussion with an infamous letter pointing out that issue of supplies of munition of a special kind was not raised during discussion but that he had nothing further to add in doing so report concluded he tacitly gave united states go ahead to store nuclear weapons at thule report also confirmed that united states stockpiled nuclear weapons in greenland until 1965 contradicting assurances by danish foreign minister niels helveg petersen that weapons were in greenland s airspace but never on ground dupi report also revealed details of project a hitherto secret united states army plan to store up to 600 nuclear missiles under greenland ice cap workers compensation claims thumb upright a monitor checks a pump operator for radioactive contamination during project crested ice alt a worker stands and waits while a colleague scans him for signs of radioactivity steel tanks with crested ice painted on them are visible in background danish workers involved in clean up operation claimed long term health problems resulted from their exposure to radiation although they did not work at camp hunziker danes worked at tank farm where contaminated ice was collected in port where contaminated debris was shipped from and they also serviced vehicles used in clean up it is also possible that they were exposed to radiation in local atmosphere many of workers surveyed in years following project crested ice reported health problems a 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1 500 workers in 1986 danish prime minister poul schluter commissioned a radiological examination of surviving workers danish institute for clinical epidemiology concluded 11 months later that cancer incidents were 40 percent higher in project crested ice workers than in workers who had visited base before and after operation institute of cancer epidemiology found a 50 percent higher cancer rate in workers than in general population but could not conclude that radiation exposure was to blame in 1987 almost 200 former cleanup workers took legal action against united states action was unsuccessful but resulted in release of hundreds of classified documents documents revealed that usaf personnel involved in clean up were not subsequently monitored for health problems despite likelihood of greater exposure to radiation than danes united states has since instigated regular examinations of its workers in 1995 danish government paid 1 700 workers compensation of 50 000 kroner each danish workers health has not been regularly monitored despite a european court directive to danish government to begin examinations in year 2000 and a may 2007 european parliament resolution instructing same european parliament 2007 in 2008 association of former thule workers took case to european courts petitioners claimed that denmark s failure to comply with rulings led to delays in detecting their illnesses resulting in worsened prognoses country joined european atomic energy community in 1973 and is therefore not legally bound by european treaty with respect to events in 1968 when accident occurred denmark was not a member state and could not therefore be considered as being bound by community legislation applicable at that time obligations of denmark towards workers and population likely to be affected by accident could only flow from national legislation european parliament 2004 danish government rejected a link between accident and long term health issues dr kaare of danish national institute of radiation protection said we have very good registers for cancer incidents and cancer mortality and we have made a very thorough investigation workers said lack of proof was attributable to lack of appropriate medical monitoring as of november 2008 case has been unsuccessful a 2011 report by danish national board of health found that total radiation dose for representative persons in thule area for plutonium contamination resulting from 1968 thule accident is lower than recommended reference level even under extreme conditions and situations scientific studies radioactive contamination occurred particularly in marine environment fissile material in weapons consisted mostly of uranium 235 while radioactive debris consists of at least two different source terms scientific monitoring of site has been carried out periodically with expeditions in 1968 1970 1974 1979 1984 1991 1997 and 2003 a 1997 international expedition of mainly danish and finnish scientists carried out a comprehensive sediment sampling program in north star bay main conclusions were plutonium has not moved from contaminated sediments into surface water in shelf sea debris has been buried to a great depth in sediment as a result of biological activity transfer of plutonium to benthic biota is low other research indicates that uranium is leaching from contaminated particles faster than plutonium and americium research conducted in 2003 concluded plutonium in marine environment at thule presents an insignificant risk to man most plutonium remains in seabed under sound far from man under relatively stable conditions and concentrations of plutonium in seawater and animals are low however plutonium contamination of surface soil at could constitute a small risk to humans visiting location if radioactive particles are resuspended in air so that they might be inhaled in 2003 2007 and 2008 first samples were taken on land by riso national laboratory findings were published in 2011 literature review of declassified documents a bbc news report in 2008 confirmed through declassified documents and interviews with those involved that a bomb had been lost danish foreign ministry reviewed 348 documents that bbc obtained in 2001 under freedom of information act in january 2009 foreign minister per stig moller commissioned a study by danish institute for international studies diis to compare 348 documents with 317 documents released by department of energy in 1994 in order to determine if 348 documents contained any new information about an intact nuclear weapon at thule in august 2009 diis published its report which contradicted assertions of bbc report concluded that there was no missing bomb and that american underwater operation was a search for uranium 235 of fissile core of a secondary for first time report was able to present an estimate of amount of plutonium contained in pits of
