edward drinker cope july 28 1840 april 12 1897 was an american paleontologist and comparative anatomist as well as a noted herpetologist and ichthyologist he was a founder of neo lamarckism school of thought born to a wealthy quaker family cope distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science he published his first scientific paper at age of 19 though his father tried to raise cope as a gentleman farmer he eventually acquiesced to his son s scientific aspirations cope married his cousin and had one child family moved from philadelphia to haddonfield new jersey although cope would maintain a residence and museum in philadelphia in his later years cope had little formal scientific training and he eschewed a teaching position for field work he made regular trips to american west prospecting in 1870s and 1880s often as a member of united states geological survey teams a personal feud between cope and paleontologist othniel charles marsh led to a period of intense fossil finding competition now known as bone wars cope s financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in 1880s forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection he experienced a resurgence in his career toward end of his life before dying on april 12 1897 though cope s scientific pursuits nearly bankrupted him his contributions helped to define field of american paleontology he was a prodigious writer with 1 400 papers published over his lifetime although his rivals debated accuracy of his rapidly published works he discovered described and named more than 1 000 vertebrate species including hundreds of fishes and dozens of dinosaurs his proposal for origin of mammalian molars is notable among his theoretical contributions cope s rule however hypothesis that mammalian lineages gradually grow larger over geologic time while named after him is neither explicit nor implicit in his work polly alroy 1998 biography early life thumb cope was taken on a sea trip to boston one week

eldest son of alfred and hanna cope davidson 7 death of his mother when he was three years old seemed to have had little effect on young edward as he mentioned in his letters that he had no recollection of her his stepmother rebecca biddle filled maternal role cope referred to her warmly as well as his younger stepbrother james biddle cope alfred an orthodox member of religious society of friends or quakers operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father thomas p cope in 1821 he was a philanthropist who gave money to society of friends philadelphia zoological gardens and institute for colored youth scharf and westcott 2216 edward was born and raised in a large stone house called fairfield whose location is now within boundaries of philadelphia of pristine and exotic gardens of house offered a landscape that edward was able to explore lanham 60 63 copes began teaching their children to read and write at a very young age and took edward on trips across new england and to museums zoos and gardens cope s interest in animals became apparent at a young age as did his natural artistic ability davidson 8 alfred intended to give his son same education he himself had received at age nine edward was sent to a day school in philadelphia and in 1853 at age of 12 edward was sent to friends boarding school at westtown near west chester pennsylvania osborn 40 school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of society of friends quakers and provided much of cope family s education davidson 9 prestigious school was expensive costing alfred 500 in tuition each year and in his first year edward studied algebra chemistry scripture physiology grammar astronomy and latin davidson 12 edward s letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father and he was according to author and cope biographer jane davidson a bit of a spoiled brat davidson 11 his letters suggest he was lonely at school it was first time he had been away from his home for an extended period otherwise edward s studies progressed much like a typical boy he consistently had less than perfect or not quite satisfactory marks for conduct from his teachers and did not work hard on his penmanship lessons which may have contributed to his often illegible handwriting as an adult edward returned to westtown in 1855 accompanied by two of his sisters biology began to interest him more that year and he studied natural history texts in his spare time while at school he frequently visited academy of natural sciences edward often obtained bad marks due to quarreling and bad conduct his letters to his father show he chafed at farm work and betrayed flashes of temper for which he would later become well known davidson 15 after sending edward back to farm for summer break in 1854 and 1855 alfred did not return edward to school after spring 1856 instead alfred attempted to turn his son into a gentleman farmer which he considered a wholesome profession that would yield enough profit to lead a comfortable life and improve undersized edward s health lanham 63 until 1863 cope s letters to his father continually expressed his yearning for a more professional scientific career than that of a farmer which he called dreadfully boring osborn 100 while working on farms edward continued his education on his own in 1858 he began working part time at academy of natural sciences reclassifying and cataloguing specimens and published his first series of research results in january 1859 cope began taking french and german classes with a former westtown teacher though alfred resisted his son s pursuit of a science career he paid for his son s private studies davidson 17 instead of working farm his father bought for him edward rented out land and used income to further his scientific endeavors lanham 64 alfred finally gave in to edward s wishes and paid for university classes cope attended university of pennsylvania in 1861 and or 1862 academic years davidson 20 studying comparative anatomy under joseph leidy one of most influential anatomists and paleontologists at time osborn 80 cope asked his father to pay for a tutor in both german and french not so much for their own sake wrote edward but as for their value in enabling me to read their books of a literary or scientific character osborn 101 during this period he had a job herpetological collection at academy of natural sciences where he became a member at leidy s urging davidson 21 cope s job lasted two years and he visited smithsonian institution on occasion where he became acquainted with spencer baird who was an expert in fields of ornithology and ichthyology osborn 107 in 1861 he published his first paper on classification over next five years he published primarily on reptiles and amphibians gill 835 cope s membership in academy of natural sciences and american philosophical society gave him outlets to publish and announce his work many of his early paleontological works were published by philosophical society davidson 22 european travels in 1863 1864 during american civil war cope traveled through europe taking opportunity to visit most esteemed museums and societies of time initially he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital but in letters to his father later on in war this aspiration seemed to disappear instead he considered working in american south to assist freed african americans davidson suggests cope s correspondence with leidy and ferdinand hayden who worked as field surgeons during war might have informed cope of horrors of occupation davidson 26 27 edward was involved in a love affair his father did not approve lanham 66 whether edward or unnamed woman whom he at one point intended to marry broke off relationship is unknown but he took breakup poorly davidson 29 30 biographer and paleontologist henry fairfield osborn attributed edward s sudden departure for europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into civil war osborn 106 cope did write to his father from london on february 11 1864 i shall get home in time to catch and be caught by new draft i shall not be sorry for this as i know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that i have gone to europe to avoid war osborn 138 eventually cope took pragmatic approach and waited out conflict he may have suffered from mild depression during this period and often complained of boredom despite his torpor edward proceeded with his tour of europe and met with some of most highly esteemed scientists of world during his travels through france germany great britain ireland austria italy and eastern europe most likely with introductory letters from leidy and spencer baird davidson 29 in winter of 1863 edward met othniel charles marsh while in berlin marsh age 32 was attending university of berlin he held two university degrees in comparison to edward s lack of formal schooling past 16 but edward had written 37 scientific papers in comparison to marsh s two published works while they would later become rivals on meeting two men appeared to take a liking to each other marsh led edward on a tour of city and they stayed together for days after edward left berlin two maintained correspondence exchanging manuscripts fossils and photographs edward burned many of his journals and letters from europe upon his return to united states friends intervened and stopped cope from destroying some of his drawings and notes in what author url lanham deemed a partial suicide lanham 67 family and early career when cope returned to philadelphia in 1864 his family made every effort to secure him a teaching post as professor of zoology at haverford college a small quaker school where family had philanthropic ties college awarded him an honorary master s degree so he could have position cope even began to think about marriage and consulted his father in matter telling him of girl he would like to marry an amiable woman not over sensitive with considerable energy and especially one inclined to be serious and not inclined to frivolity and display more truly christian of course better seems to be most practically most suitable for me though intellect and accomplishments have more charm cope thought of annie pim a member of society of friends as less a lover than companion declaring her and domestic qualities generally her capability of taking care of a house etc as well as her steady seriousness weigh far more with me than any of traits which form theme of poets cope s family approved of his choice and marriage took place in july 1865 at pim s farmhouse in chester county pennsylvania osborn 142 two had a single daughter julia biddle cope born june 10 1866 cope s return to united states also marked an expansion of his scientific studies in 1864 he described several fishes a whale and amphibian his first paleontological contribution during period between 1866 and 1867 cope went on trips to western parts of country osborn 143 osborn 146 he related to his father his scientific experiences to his daughter he sent descriptions of animal life as part of her education cope found educating his students at haverford a pleasure but wrote to his father that he could not get any work done davidson 31 he resigned from his position at haverford and moved his family to haddonfield in part to be closer to fossil beds of western new jersey due to time consuming nature of his haverford position cope had not had time to attend to his farm and had let it out to others but eventually found he was in need of more money to fuel his scientific habits osborn 144 pleading with his father for money to pursue his career he finally sold farm in 1869 davidson 33 alfred apparently did not press his son to continue farming and edward focused on his scientific career osborn 145 he continued his continental travels including trips to virginia tennessee and north carolina osborn 151 154 he visited caves across region he stopped these cave explorations after an 1871 trip to wyandotte caves in indiana but remained interested in subject osborn 155 cope had visited haddonfield many times in 1860s paying periodic visits to marl pits fossils he found in these pits became focus of several papers including a description in 1868 of elasmosaurus and laelaps marsh accompanied him on one of these excursions cope s proximity to beds after moving to haddonfield made more frequent trips possible copes lived comfortably in a frame house backed by an apple orchard two maids tended estate which entertained a number of guests cope s only concern was for more money to spend on his scientific work osborn 157 158 1870s were golden years of cope s career marked by his most prominent discoveries and rapid flow of publications among his descriptions were therapsid 1870 cope 1870 champsosaurus 1876 cope 1876 and sauropod amphicoelias 1878 cope 1878 possibly largest dinosaur ever discovered carpenter 131 in period of one year from 1879 to 1880 cope published 76 papers based on his travels through new mexico and colorado and on findings of his collectors in texas kansas oregon colorado wyoming and utah davidson 43 during peak years cope published around 25 reports and preliminary observations each year hurried publications led to errors in interpretation and naming many of his scientific names were later canceled or withdrawn in comparison marsh wrote and published less frequently and more succinctly his works appearance in widespread american journal of science led to faster reception abroad and subsequently marsh s reputation grew more rapidly than cope s cope 216 thumb left upright cope s pine street residence alt end section of a four story stone terraced

one of marsh s guides benjamin mudge who was in want of a job osborn 159 160 cope s companion charles sternberg described lack of water and good food available to cope and his helpers on these expeditions cope would suffer from a severe attack of nightmare in which every animal of which we had found trace during day played with him at night sometimes he would lose half night in this exhausting slumber nevertheless cope continued to lead party from sunrise to sunset sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds osborn 167 severe desert conditions and cope s habit of himself till he was bedridden caught up with him and in 1872 he broke down from exhaustion cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879 throughout decade cope traveled across west exploring rocks of eocene in 1872 and titanothere beds of colorado in 1873 osborn 183 osborn 194 in 1874 cope was employed with wheeler survey a group of surveys led by george montague wheeler that mapped parts of united states west of 100th meridian survey traveled through new mexico whose puerco formations he wrote to his father provided most important find in geology i have ever made osborn 200 new mexico bluffs contained millions of years of formation and subsequent deformation and were in an area which had not been visited by leidy or marsh being part of survey had other advantages cope was able to draw on fort and defray publishing costs while there was no salary his findings would be published in annual reports surveys printed cope brought annie and julia along on one such survey and rented a house for them at fort bridger but he spent more of his own money on these survey trips than he would have liked alfred died december 4 1875 gill 837 and left edward with an inheritance of nearly a quarter of a million dollars alfred s death was a blow to cope his father was a constant confidant same year marked a suspension of much of cope s field work and a new emphasis on writing up discoveries of previous years his chief publication of time vertebrata of cretaceous formations of west was a collection of 303 pages and 54 illustration plates memoir summarized his experiences prospecting in new jersey and kansas cope 217 cope now had finances to hire multiple teams to search for fossils for him year round and he advised philadelphia centennial exhibition on their fossil displays cope s studies of marine reptiles of kansas closed in 1876 opening a new focus on terrestrial reptiles osborn 218 same year cope moved from haddonfield to 2100 and 2102 pine street in philadelphia he converted one of two houses into a museum where he stored his growing collection of fossils osborn 168 cope s expeditions took him across kansas colorado new mexico wyoming and montana his initial journey into clarendon beds of upper miocene and lower pliocene of texas led to an affiliation with geological survey of texas cope s papers on region constitute some of his most important paleontological contributions osborn 233 in 1877 he purchased half rights to american naturalist to publish papers he produced at a rate so high marsh questioned their dating davidson 41 cope returned to europe in august 1878 in response to an invitation to join british association for advancement of science s dublin meeting he was warmly welcomed in england and france and met with distinguished paleontologists and archeologists of period marsh s attempts to sully cope s reputation had made little impact on anyone save paleontologist thomas henry huxley who according to osborn alone treated cope with coolness osborn 243 following dublin meeting cope spent two days with french association for advancement of science at each gathering cope exhibited dinosaur restorations by philadelphia colleague john a ryder and various charts and plates from geological surveys of 1870s led by ferdinand hayden he returned to london on october 12 meeting with anatomist richard owen ichthyologist albert gunther and paleontologist h g seeley while in europe cope purchased a great collection of fossils from argentina cope never found time to

upon men s return to united states in 1860s although cope named for marsh in 1867 and marsh returned favor naming for cope in 1869 cope introduced his colleague to marl pit owner albert vorhees when two visited site marsh went behind cope s back and made a private agreement with vorhees any fossils that vorhees s men found were sent back to marsh at new haven gallagher 35 when marsh was at haddonfield examining one of cope s fossil finds a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur elasmosaurus that had four flippers and a long neck he commented that fossil s head was on wrong end evidently stating that cope had put skull at end of vertebrae of tail cope was outraged and two argued for some time until they agreed to have leidy examine bones and determine who was right leidy came picked up head of fossil and put it on other end cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on fossil with error at american philosophical society he immediately tried to buy back copies but some remained with their buyers marsh and leidy kept theirs whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had leidy not exposed cover up at next society meeting not to alienate cope but only in response to cope s brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong cope and marsh would never talk to each other amicably again and by 1873 open hostility had broken out between them thomson 229 rivalry between two increased towards latter half of 1870s in 1877 marsh received a letter from arthur lakes a schoolteacher in golden colorado lakes had been hiking in mountains near town of morrison with his friend h c beckwith looking for fossilized leaves in dakota sandstone instead pair found large bones embedded in rock lanham 170 171 lakes wrote that bones were apparently a vertebra and a humerus bone of some gigantic saurian wilford 105 while lakes sent marsh some 1 500 pounds of bone he also sent cope some of specimens marsh published his finds first and having been paid 100 for finds lakes wrote to cope that samples should be forwarded to marsh lanham 172 cope was offended by slight wilford 106 meanwhile cope received bones from school superintendent o w lucas in march 1877 from canon city remains were of a dinosaur even bigger than lakes that marsh had described word that lakes had notified cope of his finds galvanized marsh into action when marsh heard from union pacific railroad workers w e carlin and w h reed about a vast boneyard northwest of laramie in como bluff marsh sent his agent samuel wendell williston to take charge of digging lanham 174 176 cope in response learned of carlin and reed s discoveries and sent his own men to find bones in area bakker two scientists attempted to sabotage each other s progress cope was described as a genius and what marsh lacked in intelligence he easily made up for in connections marsh s uncle was george peabody a rich banker who supported marsh with money and a secure position at peabody museum marsh lobbied john wesley powell to act against cope and attempted to persuade hayden to muzzle cope s publishing both men tried to spy on other s whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors more money in hopes of recruiting them to their own side cope was able to recruit david baldwin in new mexico and frank williston in wyoming from marsh cope and marsh were extremely secretive as to source of their fossils when henry fairfield osborn at time a student at princeton visited cope to ask where to travel to look for fossils in west cope politely refused to answer osborn 579 when cope arrived back in united states after his tour of europe in 1878 he had nearly two years of fossil findings from lucas among these dinosaurs was camarasaurus one of most recognizable dinosaur recreations of time davidson 42 summer of 1879 took cope to salt lake city san francisco and north to oregon where he was amazed at rich flora and blueness of pacific ocean osborn p 269 in 1879 united states congress consolidated various government survey teams into united states geological survey with clarence king as its leader this was discouraging to cope because king named marsh an old college friend as chief paleontologist period of cope s and marsh s paleontological digs in american west spanned from 1877 to 1892 by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources later years thumb

has a flat top with a short snout and prominent canines 1880s proved disastrous for cope marsh s close association with geological survey gave him resources to employ 54 staff members over course of ten years his teaching position at yale meant he had guaranteed access to american journal of science for publication cope had his interest in naturalist but it drained him of funds after hayden was removed from survey cope lost his source of government funding his fortune was not enough to support his rivalry so cope invested in mining most of his properties were silver mines in new mexico one mine yielded an ore vein worth 3 million in silver chloride cope visited mines each summer from 1881 to 1885 taking opportunity to supervise or collect other minerals lanham 233 237 for a while he made good money but mines stopped producing and by 1886 he had to give up his now worthless stocks lanham 238 same year he received a teaching position at university of pennsylvania gill 838 he continued to travel west but realized he would not be able to best marsh in cornering market for bones he had to release collectors he had hired and sell his collections during this period he published 40 to 75 papers each year lanham 242 with failure of his mines cope began searching for a job but was turned down at smithsonian and american museum of natural history he turned to giving lectures for hire and writing magazine articles each year he lobbied congress for an appropriation with which to finish his work on cope s bible a volume on tertiary vertebrates romer 205 but was continually turned down rather than work with powell and survey cope tried to inflame sentiment against them lanham 243 244 at marsh s urging powell pushed for cope to return specimens he had unearthed during his employment under government surveys this was an outrage to cope who had used his own money while working as a volunteer lanham 249 in response cope went to editor of new york herald and promised a scandalous headline since 1885 lanham 245 cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both marsh and powell had committed over years from scientific errors to publishing mistakes he had them written down in a journal he kept in bottom drawer of his pine street desk osborn 585 cope sought out marsh s assistants who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid reporter william hosea ballou ran first article on january 12 1890 in what would become a series of newspaper debates between marsh powell and cope osborn 403 cope attacked marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement and attacked powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government allocated funds osborn 404 marsh and powell published their own side of story and in end little changed no congressional hearing was created to investigate powell s alleged of funds while cope and marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes indirectly however attacks may have been influential in marsh s fall from power in survey romer 206 due to pressure from powell over bad press marsh was removed from his position for government surveys cope s relations with president of university of pennsylvania soured and entire funding for paleontology in government surveys was pulled cope took his sinking fortunes in stride lanham 231 in writing to osborn about articles he laughed at outcome saying it will now rest largely with you whether or not i am supposed to be a liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment i think marsh is impaled on horns of monoclonius osborn 408 cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of cope and hater osborn 583 through his years of financial hardship he was able to continue publishing papers his most productive years were 1884 and 1885 with 79 and 62 papers published respectively 1880s marked publication of two of best known fossil taxa described by cope pelycosaur edaphosaurus in 1882 and early dinosaur coelophysis in 1889 cope 1889 in 1889 he succeeded leidy who had died previous year as professor of zoology at university of pennsylvania small yearly stipend was enough for cope s family to move back into one of townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier lanham 267 in 1892 cope then 52 years old was granted expense money for field work from texas geological survey with his finances improved he was able to publish a massive work on of north america which was most detailed analysis and organization of continent s frogs and amphibians ever mastered and 1 115 page crocodilians lizards and snakes of north america in 1890s his publication rate increased to an average of 43 articles a year his final expedition to west took place in 1894 when he prospected for dinosaurs in south dakota and visited sites in texas and oklahoma same year julia was married to william h collins a haverford astronomy professor couple s ages julia was 28 and groom 35 were past conventions of victorian marriage after their european honeymoon couple returned to haverford while annie moved to haverford as well cope did not his official reason was long commute and late lectures he gave in philadelphia in private correspondence however osborn wrote that two had essentially separated though they remained on amiable terms cope sold his collections to american museum of natural history in 1895 his set of 10 000 american fossil museum of natural history sold for 32 000 lower than cope s asking price of 50 000 purchase was financed by donations from new york s high society cope sold three other collections for 29 000 while his collection contained more than 13 000 specimens cope s fossil hoard was still much smaller than marsh s collection valued at over a million dollars lanham 268 university of pennsylvania bought part of cope s ethnological artifact collection for 5 500 academy of natural sciences philadelphia s foremost museum did not bid on any of cope s sales due to bad blood between cope and museum s leaders as a result many of cope s major finds left city cope s proceeds from sales allowed him to rehire sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf death thumb cope s cluttered study in 1897 pine street home was filled with cope s papers bones stuffed and

brown tended to him cope at this time lived in his pine street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds cope often prescribed himself medications including large amounts of morphine belladonna and formalin a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens osborn was horrified by cope s actions and made arrangements for surgery but plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in cope s health cope went to virginia looking for fossils became ill again and returned to his home very weak osborn visited cope on april 5 inquiring about cope s health but sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on origin of mammals word of cope s illness spread and he was visited by friends and colleagues even in a feverish condition cope delivered lectures from his bed cope died on april 12 1897 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday sternberg still prospecting for cope that spring was woken by a liveryman who relayed word from annie that cope had died three days earlier sternberg wrote in his memoirs i had lost friends before and i had known what it was to bury my own dead even my firstborn son but i had never sorrowed more deeply than i did over news cope s quaker funeral consisted of six men osborn his colleague william berryman scott cope s friend frazer son in law collins horatio wood and harrison allen six sat around cope s coffin among fossils and cope s pets a tortoise and a gila monster for what osborn called a perfect quaker silence an interminable length of time lanham 269 anticipating quiet osborn had brought along a bible and read an excerpt from book of job ending by saying these are problems to which our friend devoted his life coffin was loaded on a hearse and carried to a gathering at fairfield much of gathering was spent in silence after coffin was removed assembled began talking frazer recalled that each person remembered cope differently and few men succeeded so well in concealing from anyone all sides of his character osborn intending to follow coffin to graveyard was instead pulled aside by collins and taken to reading of cope s will osborn and cope s brother in law john garrett were named executors cope gave his family a choice of his books with remainder to be sold or donated to university of pennsylvania after debts were handled cope left small bequests to friends and family anna brown and julia received 5000 each while remainder went to annie cope s estate was valued at 75 327 not including additional revenue raised by sales of fossils to american museum of natural history for a total of 84 600 some specimens preserved in alcohol made their way to academy of natural sciences including a few gordian worms montgomery 95 cope insisted through his will that no graveside service or burial be held he had donated his body to science he issued a final challenge to marsh at his death he had his skull donated to science so his brain could be measured hoping his brain would be larger than that of his adversary at time brain size was thought to be true measure of intelligence marsh never accepted challenge and cope s skull is reportedly still preserved at university of pennsylvania dodson associated press his ashes were placed at institute with those of leidy while his bones were extracted and kept in a locked drawer to be studied by anatomy students davidson 160 osborn listed cope s cause of death as uremic poisoning combined with a large prostate but true cause of death is unknown many believed cope had died of syphilis contracted from women with whom he fraternized during his travels in 1995 davidson gained permission to have skeleton examined by a medical doctor at university dr a professor of radiology concluded no evidence of bony syphilis was found on cope s skeleton davidson 161 public mentions of cope s death were relatively slight naturalist ran four photographs a six page obituary by editor j s kingsley and a two page remembrance by frazer national academy of sciences official memoir was submitted years later and written by osborn american journal of science devoted six paragraphs to cope s passing and incorrectly gave his age as 46 cope was outlived by his rival marsh who was suffering poor health evolution as a young man cope read charles darwin s voyage of a naturalist which had little effect on him only comment about darwin s book recorded by cope was that darwin discussed too much geology from account of his voyage davidson 16 due to his background in taxonomy and paleontology cope focused on evolution in terms of changing structure rather than emphasizing geography and variation within populations as darwin had over his lifetime cope s views on evolution shifted bowler 250 his original view described in paper on origin of genera 1868 held that while darwin s natural selection may affect preservation of superficial characteristics in organisms natural selection alone could not explain formation of genera cope s suggested mechanism for this action was a steady progressive development of organization through what cope termed a continual crowding backward of successive steps of individual development in cope s view during embryological development an organism could complete its growth with a new stage of development beyond its parents taking it to a higher level of organization later individuals would inherit this new level of development thus evolution was a continuous advance of organization sometimes slowly and other times suddenly this view is known as law of acceleration bowler 251 253 cope s beliefs later evolved to one with an increased emphasis on continual and utilitarian evolution with less involvement of a creator bowler 259 he became one of founders of neo lamarckism school of thought which holds that an individual can pass on traits acquired in its lifetime to offspring polly although view has been shown incorrect it was prevalent theory among paleontologists in cope s time lanham 68 in 1887 cope published his own origin of fittest essays in evolution detailing his views on subject alroy he was a strong believer in law of use and disuse that an individual will slowly over time favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will become stronger and larger as time progresses down generations giraffe for example stretched its neck to reach taller trees and passed this acquired characteristic to its offspring in a developmental phase that is added to gestation in womb cope 126 cope s theology of evolution 1887 argued that consciousness comes from mind of universe and governs evolution by directing animals to new goals randy moore mark decker cotner chronology of evolution creationism controversy 2010 p 140 according to 2003 cope argued that organisms respond to changes in their environments by an exercise of choice consciousness itself he maintained was principal force in evolution cope credited god with having
