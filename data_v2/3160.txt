300px thumb right example of a low key photograph low key photography is a genre of photography consisting of shooting dark colored scenes and emphasizing natural or artificial light only on specific areas in frame this photographic style is usually used to create a mysterious atmosphere that only suggests various shapes often graphic letting viewer experience photograph through subjective interpretation and often implies painting objects or human body with black non toxic dyes or pigments renaissance and baroque represented by different painting styles including sfumato and chiaroscuro used by artists like leonardo da vinci and rubens tenebroso it dark mysterious used by artists such as caravaggio rembrandt jusepe de ribera among others produced paintings in which black was predominant on canvas and light often come from only one source to achieve dramatic scenes edward weston yousuf karsh and irving penn are among photographers experienced with black on black technique etymology according to online etymology dictionary term low key appeared in 1895 a term that described something low keyed relating quiet sound or deep musical tone according to random house webster s unabridged dictionary term appeared between 1890 1895 however earliest known use of term dates back to 1830 in genius of liberty rembrandt lighting or rembrandtian light is a term correlated mostly with low key portrait photography which uses a light source and a reflector or two sources of light a main and a very low intensity fill light term was named after style of lighting face in most of rembrandt s self portraits but also in other works such as portrait of an old man in red 1652 1654 dominated by tenebrism history renaissance and baroque painters have often used sfumato chiaroscuro and later tenebroso painting modes not only to give a impression in their paintings but also to achieve a dramatic atmosphere after decline in popularity of pictorialism movement new style of photographic modernism came into vogue and public s interest shifted to more sharply focused images edward steichen imogen cunningham and edward weston were among first photographers considered pioneers of low key photography steichen s portrait of j p morgan 1903 pastoral moonlight 1907 published in camera work no 20 cunningham s succulent 1920 and weston s pepper no 30 1930 are considered earliest low key photographs in art black regained some of territory that it had lost during 19th century russian painter kasimir malevich a member of suprematist movement created black square in 1915 is widely considered first purely abstract painting he wrote painted work is no longer simply imitation of reality but is this very reality it is not a demonstration of ability but materialization of an idea painting thumb upright detail of face of leonardo da vinci s mona lisa showing use of sfumato particularly in shading around eyes antagonism between light and shadow is a basic principle of a visual image regardless of its nature leonardo da vinci pioneered sfumato technique so he could soften transition from lighter areas to darker ones in some of his paintings in his notes about painting he highlights that light and shadow should intermingle without lines or borders in manner of smoke or beyond focus plane sfumato usually implies using many translucent layers to create a gradual tone spectrum from dark to light eliminating thus unwanted sharp contours technique is emphasized in mona lisa 1503 1506 musee du louvre paris thumb left salome with head of john baptist caravaggio thumb upright left an old man in red rembrandt on other hand chiaroscuro another oil painting technique uses strong tonal contrasts between light and dark to model three dimensional forms often to dramatic effect first use of light dark three dimensional shadows known as or shadow painting in ancient greece is traditionally attributed to athenian painter of fifth century bc apollodorus in de gloria plutarch leonardo da vinci through his virgin of rocks 1483 1486 louvre paris influenced use of chiaroscuro to create illusion of depth however term is most often associated with works created in mannerism and baroque in renaissance technique became essential to all religious painters who followed visions of bridget of sweden who claimed to have seen light of christ in paintings with religious scenes renaissance artists reassigned this holy light as predominant source of illumination relying heavily on chiaroscuro technique this compositional approach has been extensively used in tintoretto s last supper 1592 1594 if religious chiaroscuro of renaissance served to create quiet and calm scenes painters such as caravaggio veronese and georges de la tour had tendency to use this style for a dramatic effect in baroque painting relied heavily on use of shadows for their dramatic effect caravaggio has accomplished dramatic illumination to its greatest extent with his method called tenebrism a technique that has spread to europe under name of works of adam elsheimer s were a turning point between chiaroscuro and tenebrism at first glance a tenebrism painting could look very similar to one using powerful chiaroscuro effects however there is a difference between two styles chiaroscuro is a shading technique used especially to give objects illusion of volume while tenebrism is a compositional technique that uses very dark shadows in which some areas of painting are preserved darkly sometimes black allowing only one or two areas of interest to be strongly illuminated at same time transition from light to dark is not gradual style was used for a purely dramatic effect hence term dramatic illumination and there was no involvement in trying to create illusion of three dimensionality this style has been victim of many negative criticisms in baroque critics accusing artists of using this method to hide mistakes of paintings first caravaggio s art which approached new artistic style in most radical way was aimed like caravaggio rembrandt as well was accused of hiding his defects in shades painting tenebrism gave darkness a positive value both iconic and symbolic creating thus a new aesthetics darkness was equivalent to light because it conditioned glory and majesty of latter symbols of light and darkness were expressed in works of tintoretto caravaggio georges de la tour and rembrandt photography thumb 200px karsh s roaring lion in photography of one of most prominent portraitists canadian yousuf karsh 1908 2002 light only outlines face it may highlight it more or less intensely but from an artistic point of view light plays a secondary role in scene along with main subject his portraits contain large areas of black and subject appears like a spot in that achromatic nothingness nothing competes with areas of his subjects faces being highlighted which gives portraits an almost mystical aura thus in portrait of winston churchill which according to economist is most reproduced portrait in history of photography and has been described as one of most iconic portraits ever shot only his face is highlighted while his head is outlined by another very low light source coming from back in portrait of jean sibelius light is reduced even more with half of face being in gloom in helen keller with polly thompson both subjects are dressed in black and background is also entirely black so photograph gives an impression of detachment dissolution jasper johns seems to emerge from a black ocean portrait of french writer francois mauriac is only contoured from semi profile only an almost abstracted line appearing on black background strong contrast between black and white and use of this contrast to overcome classical portraits is characteristic of all these portraits thus creating a dramatic enigmatic mystical atmosphere abundantly making use of so called active black yousuf karsh is considered to be one of contemporary artists who adopt low key photographic style in most efficient manner being called one of 20th century s great portrait photographers by time magazine other noteworthy examples that deal with black hues photography include paul strand s blind 1916 where subject is deliberately shadowed in order to create gloomy atmosphere of image and blind sign is lit ansel adams s mt moran teton national park natural light falls only on peak of mountain while rest of photo is a mixture of dark grey tones some of edward weston s photographs are also illustrative of low key style such as nautilus 1930 pepper no 30 1930 cabbage leaf 1931 brassai s filles de joie quartier italie 1932 bresson s nehru announces gandhi s death 1948 in 1944 robert capa takes photos of picasso in natural light that only highlights right half of his face leaving left one in shade irving penn 1917 2009 took several low key photographs of american jazz trumpeter and composer miles davis among postmodernist photographers australian bill henson photographs controversial nudes in low key elad david works mainly with male nudes and in some of them only busts no head of young men is highlighted leaving everything else in pitch black another artist who created a series of low key photos exhibited in numerous exhibitions around world is finnish photographer juha arvid he named his series invisible empire and refers to shield that black colour offers like a mask between who we truly are and way society perceives us technique thumb upright painting a subject using acrylic black paint mixed with body cream taking low key photographs is possible in dark rooms where light penetrates only through a small window or a single unidirectional soft light but best results are achieved by using artificial studio lights sometimes a single directed light source is sufficient usually well targeted sources are used to get desired effect since a large light source could considerably reduce desired result special attention is paid to having sufficient neutral details that will invariably be left in shade this type of lighting is also known as rembrandtian light there are various technical challenges depending on subject what photographer wants to highlight or how many subjects are in frame therefore photographing a single person and for instance if photographer wants to highlight only half of subject s face a single light source placed laterally at a certain distance and angle to subject and possibly a blend will be usually used experimenting with different light intensities is performed until desired effect is achieved for photographing two people or a static scene two or even three sources of light one or two for contour and a very low intensity fill light are usually used background is kept dark ideally fully black as well as part of face that will remain in shade relative power of main and fill lights known as light ratio can be measured using a light meter low key technique has a higher light ratio for example 8 1 while high key technique has a lower ratio around 1 1 according to photographer gavin hoey first attention to detail has to be background it is best to keep it black or dark gray and from there it is about improvising to achieve that perfect shot you have in mind lights talking advises choosing and maintaining lowest iso 100 64 or even 32 to get noise free photographs painting human body in black unlike tattoo and other forms of body art body painting is temporary painted onto human skin and can last several hours or many weeks in case of mehndi or henna tattoos about two weeks painting human body in black is also employed in low key photography using non toxic dyes or pigments in order to darken and enhance as much as possible colour of subjects photographed and to achieve desired effects in order to achieve effect of reflection of light that creates a white contour of painted body as well as a high contrast between black and white various dyes mixed with body creams are used these usually include henna tempera or acrylic paint liquid latex which is composed of natural latex and dyes is also used with caution to avoid stopping skin to breathe acrylic paint can be applied on body with simple brushes or this is one of most used techniques because it dries very fast provides elasticity and does not stain since it is a water
