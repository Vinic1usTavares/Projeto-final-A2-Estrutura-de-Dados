expected but your country is at stake your wives your houses and all that you hold dear you have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships but we know not how to spare you if you will consent to stay only one month longer you will render that service to cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances at first no one stepped forward but then

took over his command as british came within range american riflemen opened fire ketchum p 289 american riflemen took cover in woods ravines and even in bends in road and each time british would line up in a battle line riflemen would fall back and fire from cover after hand was forced to abandon american position along five mile run he took up a new position a heavily wooded area on south bank of shabakunk creek hand deployed his men in trees where they were so well protected from view that british could not see them as they crossed bridge over stream riflemen fired at them from point blank range intense fire confused british into thinking that entire american army was up against them and they formed into battle lines bringing up their cannon british searched woods for a half an hour looking for americans but hand had already withdrawn to a new position by three in afternoon british had reached a ravine known as stockton hollow about a half a mile 0 8 km from trenton where americans were forming another line of defense washington wanted to hold british off until nightfall when darkness would prevent british from attacking his defenses on south side of assunpink creek british with artillery in position attacked hand s new position and he gave way slowly falling back into trenton along way hand had his troops fire from behind houses ketchum p 290 as hand s troops

withdrawal cornwallis decision when cornwallis arrived in trenton with main army he called a council of war as to whether or not he should continue to attack ketchum p 291 cornwallis quartermaster general william erskine urged cornwallis to strike right away saying if washington is general i take him to be his army will not be found there in morning but james grant disagreed and argued that there was no way for americans to retreat and that british troops were worn out and that it would be better for them to attack in morning after they had rested cornwallis did not want to wait until morning but he decided that it would be better than sending his troops out to attack in dark cornwallis said we ve got old fox safe now we ll go over and bag him in morning cornwallis then moved his army to a hill north of trenton for night washington s decision during night american artillery under command of henry knox occasionally fired shells into trenton to keep british on edge as cornwallis
