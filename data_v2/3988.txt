human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome hiv aids is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus hiv following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza like illness typically this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms as infection progresses it interferes more with immune system increasing risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis as well as other opportunistic infections and tumors that rarely affect people who have uncompromised immune systems these late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids this stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss hiv is spread primarily by unprotected sex including anal and oral sex contaminated blood transfusions hypodermic needles and from mother to child during pregnancy delivery or breastfeeding some bodily fluids such as saliva sweat and tears do not transmit hiv methods of prevention include safe sex needle exchange programs treating those who are infected pre and post exposure prophylaxis and male circumcision disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both mother and child antiretroviral medication there is no cure or vaccine however antiretroviral treatment can slow course of disease and may lead to a near normal life expectancy treatment is recommended as soon as diagnosis is made without treatment average survival time after infection is 11 years in 2018 about 37 9 million people were living with hiv and it resulted in 770 000 deaths an estimated 20 6 million of these live in sub saharan africa between time that aids was identified in early 1980s and 2017 disease caused an estimated 35 million deaths worldwide hiv aids is considered a pandemic a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading subscription required hiv originated in west central africa during late 19th or early 20th century aids was first recognized by united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc in 1981 and its cause hiv infection was identified in early part of decade hiv aids has had a large impact on society both as an illness and as a source of discrimination disease also has large economic impacts there are many misconceptions about hiv aids such as belief that it can be transmitted by casual non sexual contact disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including catholic church s position not to support condom use as prevention it has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large scale funding since it was identified in 1980s thumb thumbtime 2 46 upright 1 4 video summary script signs and symptoms there are three main stages of hiv infection acute infection clinical latency and aids mandell bennett and dolan 2010 chapter 121 acute infection thumb upright 1 25 alt a diagram of a human torso labelled with most common symptoms of an acute hiv infection main symptoms of acute hiv infection initial period following contraction of hiv is called acute hiv primary hiv or acute retroviral syndrome many individuals develop an influenza like illness or a mononucleosis like illness 2 4 weeks after exposure while others have no significant symptoms symptoms occur in 40 90 of cases and most commonly include fever large tender lymph nodes throat inflammation a rash headache tiredness and or sores of mouth and genitals rash which occurs in 20 50 of cases presents itself on trunk and is classically some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or guillain barre syndrome also occurs duration of symptoms varies but is usually one or two weeks owing to their nonspecific character these symptoms are not often recognized as signs of hiv infection even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms thus it is recommended that hiv be considered in people presenting with an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for infection mandell bennett and dolan 2010 chapter 118 clinical latency initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency asymptomatic hiv or chronic hiv without treatment this second stage of natural history of hiv infection can last from about three years to over 20 years on average about eight years while typically there are few or no symptoms at first near end of this stage many people experience fever weight loss gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains between 50 and 70 of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy characterized by unexplained non painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes other than in groin for over three to six months although most hiv 1 infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in absence of treatment will eventually progress to aids a small proportion about 5 retain high levels of cd4 t cells t helper cells without antiretroviral therapy for more than five years these individuals are classified as hiv controllers or long term another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti retroviral treatment known as elite controllers or elite they represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons acquired immunodeficiency syndrome thumb upright 1 25 alt a diagram of a human torso labelled with most common symptoms of aids main symptoms of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids is defined in terms of either a cd4 t cell count below 200 cells per ul or occurrence of specific diseases in association with an hiv infection in absence of specific treatment around half of people infected with hiv develop aids within ten years most common initial conditions that alert to presence of aids are pneumocystis pneumonia 40 cachexia in form of hiv wasting syndrome 20 and esophageal candidiasis other common signs include recurrent respiratory tract infections opportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria viruses fungi and parasites that are normally controlled by immune system which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in person s environment these infections may affect nearly every organ system people with aids have an increased risk of developing various viral induced cancers including kaposi s sarcoma burkitt s lymphoma primary central nervous system lymphoma and cervical cancer kaposi s sarcoma is most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20 of people with hiv mandell bennett and dolan 2010 chapter 169 second most common cancer is lymphoma which is cause of death of nearly 16 of people with aids and is initial sign of aids in 3 to 4 both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 hhv 8 cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with aids because of its association with human papillomavirus hpv conjunctival cancer of layer that lines inner part of eyelids and white part of eye is also more common in those with hiv additionally people with aids frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers sweats particularly at night swollen lymph nodes chills weakness and unintended weight loss diarrhea is another common symptom present in about 90 of people with aids they can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers transmission hiv is spread by three main routes sexual contact significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues and from mother to child during pregnancy delivery or breastfeeding known as vertical transmission there is no risk of acquiring hiv if exposed to feces nasal secretions saliva sputum sweat tears urine or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood it is also possible to be co infected by more than one strain of hiv a condition known as hiv sexual most frequent mode of transmission of hiv is through sexual contact with an infected person however an hiv positive person who has an undetectable viral load as a result of long term treatment has effectively no risk of transmitting hiv sexually globally most common mode of hiv transmission is via sexual contacts between people of opposite sex however pattern of transmission varies among countries most hiv transmission in united states occurred among men who had sex with men 82 of new hiv diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 70 of total new diagnoses in us gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92 of new hiv diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27 of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men about 15 of gay and bisexual men have hiv while 28 of transgender women test positive in us with regard to unprotected heterosexual contacts estimates of risk of hiv transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low income countries than in high income countries in low income countries risk of female to male transmission is estimated as 0 38 per act and of male to female transmission as 0 30 per act equivalent estimates for high income countries are 0 04 per act for female to male transmission and 0 08 per act for male to female transmission risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high estimated as 1 4 1 7 per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts while risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low it is still present risk from receiving oral sex has been described as nearly nil however a few cases have been reported per act risk is estimated at 0 0 04 for receptive oral intercourse in settings involving prostitution in low income countries risk of female to male transmission has been estimated as 2 4 per act and of male to female transmission as 0 05 per act risk of transmission increases in presence of many sexually transmitted infections and genital ulcers genital ulcers appear to increase risk approximately fivefold other sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea chlamydia trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk of transmission viral load of an infected person is an important risk factor in both sexual and mother to child transmission during first 2 5 months of an hiv infection a person s infectiousness is twelve times higher due to high viral load associated with acute hiv if person is in late stages of infection rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater commercial sex workers including those in pornography have an increased likelihood of contracting hiv rough sex can be a factor associated with an increased risk of transmission sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of hiv transmission as condoms are rarely worn physical trauma to vagina or rectum is likely and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections body fluids thumb alt a black and white poster of a young black man with a towel in his left hand with words if you are dabbling with drugs you could be dabbling with your life above him cdc poster from 1989 highlighting threat of aids associated with drug use second most frequent mode of hiv transmission is via blood and blood products blood borne transmission can be through needle sharing during intravenous drug use needle stick injury transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product or medical injections with equipment risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0 63 and 2 4 per act with an average of 0 8 risk of acquiring hiv from a needle stick from an hiv infected person is estimated as 0 3 about 1 in 333 per act and risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0 09 about 1 in 1000 per act this risk may however be up to 5 if person blood was from has a high viral load and cut was deep in united states intravenous drug users made up 12 of all new cases of hiv in 2009 and in some areas more than 80 of people who inject drugs are hiv positive hiv is transmitted in about 93 of blood transfusions using infected blood in developed countries risk of acquiring hiv from a blood transfusion is extremely low less than one in half a million where improved donor selection and hiv screening is performed for example in uk risk is reported at one in five million and in united states it was one in 1 5 million in 2008 in low income countries only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened as of 2008 unaids 2011 pg 60 70 and it is estimated that up to 15 of hiv infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products representing between 5 and 10 of global infections it is possible to acquire hiv from organ and tissue transplantation although this is rare because of screening unsafe medical injections play a role in hiv spread in sub saharan africa in 2007 between 12 and 17 of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use world health organization estimates risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in africa at 1 2 risks are also associated with invasive procedures assisted delivery and dental care in this area of world people giving or receiving tattoos piercings and scarification are theoretically at risk of infection but no confirmed cases have been documented it is not possible for mosquitoes or other insects to transmit hiv mother to child hiv can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy during delivery or through breast milk resulting in baby also contracting hiv this is third most common way in which hiv is transmitted globally in absence of treatment risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20 and in those who also breastfeed 35 as of 2008 vertical transmission accounted for about 90 of cases of hiv in children with appropriate treatment risk of mother to child infection can be reduced to about 1 preventive treatment involves mother taking antiretrovirals during pregnancy and delivery an elective caesarean section avoiding breastfeeding and administering antiretroviral drugs to newborn antiretrovirals when taken by either mother or infant decrease risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed however many of these measures are not available in developing world if blood contaminates food during pre chewing it may pose a risk of transmission if a woman is untreated two years of breastfeeding results in an hiv aids risk in her baby of about 17 treatment decreases this risk to one of 1 to 2 per year due to increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in developing world world health organization recommends either 1 mother and baby being treated with antiretroviral medication while breastfeeding being continued or 2 provision of safe formula

smaller red object attached to it multiple small green spots are speckled over both scanning electron micrograph of hiv 1 colored green budding from a cultured lymphocyte hiv is cause of spectrum of disease known as hiv aids hiv is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of human immune system such as cd4 t cells macrophages and dendritic cells it directly and indirectly destroys cd4 t cells hiv is a member of genus part of family lentiviruses share many morphological and biological characteristics many species of mammals are infected by lentiviruses which are characteristically responsible for long duration illnesses with a long incubation period lentiviruses are transmitted as single stranded positive sense enveloped rna viruses upon entry into target cell viral rna genome is converted reverse transcribed into double stranded dna by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with viral genome in virus particle resulting viral dna is then imported into cell nucleus and integrated into cellular dna by a virally encoded and host co factors once integrated virus may become latent allowing virus and its host cell to avoid detection by immune system alternatively virus may be transcribed producing new rna genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from cell as new virus particles that begin replication cycle anew hiv is now known to spread between cd4 t cells by two parallel routes cell free spread and cell to cell spread i e it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms in cell free spread virus particles bud from an infected t cell enter blood extracellular fluid and then infect another t cell following a chance encounter hiv can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell to cell spread hybrid spreading mechanisms of hiv contribute to virus s ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies two types of hiv have been characterized hiv 1 and hiv 2 hiv 1 is virus that was originally discovered and initially referred to also as lav or htlv iii it is more virulent more infective and is cause of majority of hiv infections globally lower infectivity of hiv 2 as compared with hiv 1 implies that fewer people exposed to hiv 2 will be infected per exposure because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission hiv 2 is largely confined to west africa pathophysiology thumb upright 1 4 alt video of aids explanation hiv aids explained in a simple way thumb upright 1 4 hiv replication cycle after virus enters body there is a period of rapid viral replication leading to an abundance of virus in peripheral blood during primary infection level of hiv may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood this response is accompanied by a marked drop in number of circulating cd4 t cells acute is almost invariably associated with activation of cd8 t cells which kill hiv infected cells and subsequently with antibody production or seroconversion cd8 t cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels which peak and then decline as cd4 t cell counts recover a good cd8 t cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis though it does not eliminate virus ultimately hiv causes aids by depleting cd4 t cells this weakens immune system and allows opportunistic infections t cells are essential to immune response and without them body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells mechanism of cd4 t cell depletion differs in acute and chronic phases during acute phase hiv induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cd8 t cells accounts for cd4 t cell depletion although apoptosis may also be a factor during chronic phase consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with gradual loss of ability of immune system to generate new t cells appear to account for slow decline in cd4 t cell numbers although symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of aids do not appear for years after a person is infected bulk of cd4 t cell loss occurs during first weeks of infection especially in intestinal mucosa which harbors majority of lymphocytes found in body reason for preferential loss of mucosal cd4 t cells is that majority of mucosal cd4 t cells express ccr5 protein which hiv uses as a co receptor to gain access to cells whereas only a small fraction of cd4 t cells in bloodstream do so a specific genetic change that alters ccr5 protein when present in both chromosomes very effectively prevents hiv 1 infection hiv seeks out and destroys ccr5 expressing cd4 t cells during acute infection a vigorous immune response eventually controls infection and initiates clinically latent phase cd4 t cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected continuous hiv replication causes a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout chronic phase immune activation which is reflected by increased activation state of immune cells and release of pro inflammatory cytokines results from activity of several hiv gene products and immune response to ongoing hiv replication it is also linked to breakdown of immune surveillance system of gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by depletion of mucosal cd4 t cells during acute phase of disease diagnosis thumb upright 1 35 alt a graph with two lines one in blue moves from high on right

aids is diagnosed via laboratory testing and then staged based on presence of certain signs or symptoms hiv screening is recommended by united states preventive services task force for all people 15 years to 65 years of age including all pregnant women additionally testing is recommended for those at high risk which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness in many areas of world a third of hiv carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of disease when aids or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent hiv testing most people infected with hiv develop specific antibodies i e within three to twelve weeks after initial infection diagnosis of primary hiv before seroconversion is done by measuring hiv rna or p24 antigen positive results obtained by antibody or pcr testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by pcr antibody tests in children younger than 18 months are typically inaccurate due to continued presence of maternal antibodies thus hiv infection can only be diagnosed by pcr testing for hiv rna or dna or via testing for p24 antigen much of world lacks access to reliable pcr testing and people in many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or child is old enough for accurate antibody testing in sub saharan africa between 2007 and 2009 between 30 and 70 of population were aware of their hiv status unaids 2011 pg 70 80 in 2009 between 3 6 and 42 of men and women in sub saharan countries were tested this represented a significant increase compared to previous years classifications two main clinical staging systems are used to classify hiv and hiv related disease for surveillance purposes who disease staging system for hiv infection and disease and cdc classification system for hiv infection cdc s classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries since who s staging system does not require laboratory tests it is suited to resource restricted conditions encountered in developing countries where it can also be used to help guide clinical management despite their differences two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes world health organization first proposed a definition for aids in 1986 since then who classification has been updated and expanded several times with most recent version being published in 2007 who system uses following categories primary hiv infection may be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome stage i hiv infection is asymptomatic with a cd4 t cell count also known as cd4 count greater than 500 per ul or cubic mm of blood may include generalized lymph node enlargement stage ii mild symptoms which may include minor manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections a cd4 count of less than 500 ul stage iii advanced symptoms which may include unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of lung and a cd4 count of less than 350 ul stage iv or aids severe symptoms which include toxoplasmosis of brain candidiasis of esophagus trachea bronchi or lungs and kaposi s sarcoma a cd4 count of less than 200 ul united states center for disease control and prevention also created a classification system for hiv and updated it in 2008 and 2014 this system classifies hiv infections based on cd4 count and clinical symptoms and describes infection in five groups in those greater than six years of age it is stage 0 time between a negative or indeterminate hiv test followed less than 180 days by a positive test stage 1 cd4 count 500 cells ul and no aids defining conditions stage 2 cd4 count 200 to 500 cells ul and no aids defining conditions stage 3 cd4 count 200 cells ul or aids defining

infected rate of hiv infection is less than 1 per year there is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir a reverse transcriptase inhibitor immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40 among african women by contrast use of 9 may increase risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation circumcision in sub saharan africa reduces acquisition of hiv by heterosexual men by between 38 and 66 over 24 months owing to these studies both world health organization and unaids recommended male circumcision in 2007 as a method of preventing female to male hiv transmission in areas with high rates of hiv however whether it protects against male to female transmission is disputed subscription required and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined international antiviral society however does recommend it for all sexually active heterosexual males and that it be discussed as an option with men who have sex with men some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may cause more sexual risk taking behavior thus negating its preventive effects programs encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent hiv risk evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior a substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high risk practices despite knowing about hiv aids underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with hiv voluntary counseling and testing people for hiv does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive enhanced family planning services appear to increase likelihood of women with hiv using contraception compared to basic services it is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing hiv pre exposure antiretroviral treatment among people with hiv whose cd4 count 550 cells ul is a very effective way to prevent hiv infection of their partner a strategy known as treatment as prevention or tasp tasp is associated with a 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk pre exposure prophylaxis prep with a daily dose of medications tenofovir with or without emtricitabine is effective in people at high risk including men who have sex with men couples where one is hiv positive and young heterosexuals in africa it may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0 7 to 0 4 per 100 person years uspstf in 2019 recommended prep in those who are at high risk universal precautions within health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing risk of hiv intravenous drug use is an important risk factor and harm reduction strategies such as needle exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk post exposure a course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to hiv positive blood or genital secretions is referred to as post exposure prophylaxis pep use of single agent zidovudine reduces risk of a hiv infection five fold following a needle stick injury prevention regimen recommended in united states consists of three medications tenofovir emtricitabine and as this may reduce risk further pep treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when perpetrator is known to be hiv positive but is controversial when their hiv status is unknown duration of treatment is usually four weeks and is frequently associated with adverse effects where zidovudine is used about 70 of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea 24 fatigue 22 emotional distress 13 and headaches 9 mother to child programs to prevent vertical transmission of hiv from mothers to children can reduce rates of transmission by 92 99 this primarily involves use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding if replacement feeding is acceptable feasible affordable sustainable and safe mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during first months of life if this is not case if exclusive breastfeeding is carried out provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to infant decreases risk of transmission in 2015 cuba became first country in world to eradicate mother to child transmission of hiv vaccination currently there is no licensed vaccine for hiv or aids most effective vaccine trial to date rv 144

mental health with treatment there is a 70 reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother to child transmission effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance reasons for non adherence to treatment include poor access to medical care inadequate social supports mental illness

measures reduced rate of these infections by 50 between 1992 and 1997 influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with hiv aids with some evidence of benefit diet world health organization who has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in hiv aids a generally healthy diet is promoted dietary intake of micronutrients at rda levels by hiv infected adults is recommended by who higher intake of vitamin a zinc and iron can produce adverse effects in hiv positive adults and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency dietary supplementation for people who are infected with hiv and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections however evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent evidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit for pregnant and lactating women with hiv multivitamin supplement improves outcomes for both mothers and children if pregnant or lactating mother has been advised to take anti retroviral medication to prevent mother to child hiv transmission multivitamin supplements should not replace these treatments there is some evidence that vitamin a supplementation in children with an hiv infection reduces mortality and improves growth alternative medicine in us approximately 60 of people with hiv use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine even though effectiveness of most of these therapies has not been established there is not enough evidence to support use of herbal medicines there is insufficient evidence to recommend or support use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain prognosis upright 1 3 thumb deaths due to hiv aids per million persons in 2012 hiv aids has become a chronic rather than an acutely fatal disease in many areas of world prognosis varies between people and both cd4 count and viral load are useful for predicted outcomes without treatment average survival time after infection with hiv is estimated to be 9 to 11 years depending on hiv subtype after diagnosis of aids if treatment is not available survival ranges between 6 and 19 months haart and appropriate prevention of opportunistic infections reduces death rate by 80 and raises life expectancy for a newly diagnosed young adult to 20 50 years this is between two thirds and nearly that of general population if treatment is started late in infection prognosis is not as good for example if treatment is begun following diagnosis of aids life expectancy is 10 40 years half of infants born with hiv die before two years of age without treatment thumb left upright 1 3 alt a map of

of their infection about 675 000 people have died of hiv aids in us since beginning of hiv epidemic in united kingdom there were approximately 101 200 cases which resulted in 594 deaths in canada as of 2008 there were about 65 000 cases causing 53 deaths between first recognition of aids in 1981 and 2009 it has led to nearly 30 million deaths rates of hiv are lowest in north africa and middle

weekly report reported in 1981 on what was later to be called aids aids was first clinically reported on june 5 1981 with five cases in united states initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and homosexual men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of pneumocystis pneumonia pcp a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems soon thereafter an unexpected number of homosexual men developed a previously rare skin cancer called kaposi s sarcoma ks many more cases of pcp and ks emerged alerting u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc and a cdc task force was formed to monitor outbreak in early days cdc did not have an official name for disease often referring to it by way of diseases that were associated with it for example lymphadenopathy disease after which discoverers of hiv originally named virus they also used kaposi s sarcoma and opportunistic infections name by which a task force had been set up in 1981 at one point cdc coined phrase 4h disease for syndrome seemed to affect heroin users homosexuals hemophiliacs and haitians in general press term grid which stood for gay related immune deficiency had been coined however after determining that aids was not isolated to gay community it was realized that term grid was misleading and term aids was introduced at a meeting in july 1982 by september 1982 cdc started referring to disease as aids in 1983 two separate research groups led by robert gallo and luc montagnier declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with aids and published their findings in same issue of journal science gallo claimed a virus which his group had isolated from a person with aids was strikingly similar in shape to other human t lymphotropic viruses that his group had been first to isolate gallo s group called their newly isolated virus htlv iii at same time montagnier s group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of lymph nodes of neck and physical weakness two characteristic symptoms of aids contradicting report from gallo s group montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of htlv i montagnier s group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy associated virus lav as these two viruses turned out to be same in 1986 lav and htlv iii were renamed hiv origins right upright 1 35 thumb alt three primates possible sources of hiv left to right african green monkey source of siv sooty mangabey source of hiv 2 and chimpanzee source of hiv 1 both hiv 1 and hiv 2 are believed to have originated in non human primates in west central africa and were transferred to humans in early 20th century hiv 1 appears to have originated in southern cameroon through evolution of siv a simian immunodeficiency virus siv that infects wild chimpanzees hiv 1 descends from endemic in chimpanzee subspecies pan troglodytes troglodytes closest relative of hiv 2 is siv a virus of sooty mangabey atys atys an old world monkey living in coastal west africa from southern senegal to western ivory coast new world monkeys such as owl monkey are resistant to hiv 1 infection possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes subscription required hiv 1 is thought to have jumped species barrier on at least three separate occasions giving rise to three groups of virus m n and o there is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors commonly acquire siv however siv is a weak virus which is typically suppressed by human immune system within weeks of infection it is thought that several transmissions of virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into hiv furthermore due to its relatively low person to person transmission rate siv can only spread throughout population in presence of one or more high risk transmission channels which are thought to have been absent in africa before 20th century specific proposed high risk transmission channels allowing virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout society depend on proposed timing of animal to human crossing genetic studies of virus suggest that most recent common ancestor of hiv 1 m group dates back to 1910 subscription required proponents of this dating link hiv epidemic with emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial african cities leading to social changes including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity spread of prostitution and accompanying high frequency of genital ulcer diseases such as syphilis in nascent colonial cities while transmission rates of hiv during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances they are increased manyfold if one of partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection causing genital ulcers early 1900s colonial cities were notable for their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to degree that as of 1928 as many as 45 of female residents of eastern kinshasa were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15 of all residents of same city had syphilis an alternative view holds that unsafe medical practices in africa after world war ii such as reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination antibiotic and anti malaria treatment campaigns were initial vector that allowed virus to adapt to humans and spread subscription required earliest well documented case of hiv in a human dates back to 1959 in congo earliest retrospectively described case of aids is believed to have been in norway beginning in 1966 in july 1960 in wake of congo s independence united nations recruited francophone experts and technicians from all over world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by belgium who did not leave behind an african elite to run country by 1962 haitians made up second largest group of well educated experts out of 48 national groups recruited that totaled around 4500 in country dr jacques pepin a quebecer author of origins of aids stipulates that haiti was one of hiv s entry points to united states and that one of them may have carried hiv back across atlantic in 1960s although virus may have been present in united states as early as 1966 vast majority of infections occurring outside sub saharan africa including u s can be traced back to a single unknown individual who became infected with hiv in haiti and then brought infection to united states at some time around 1969 epidemic then rapidly spread among high risk groups initially sexually promiscuous men who have sex with men by 1978 prevalence of hiv 1 among homosexual male residents of new york city and san francisco was estimated at 5 suggesting that several thousand individuals in country had been infected society and culture stigma thumb alt a teenage male with hand of another resting on his left shoulder smiling for camera ryan white became a poster child for hiv after being expelled from school because he was infected aids stigma exists around world in a variety of ways including ostracism rejection discrimination and avoidance of hiv infected people compulsory hiv testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality violence against hiv infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with hiv and quarantine of hiv infected individuals stigma related violence or fear of violence prevents many people from seeking hiv testing returning for their results or securing treatment possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating spread of hiv aids stigma has been further divided into following three categories instrumental aids stigma a reflection of fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness symbolic aids stigma use of hiv aids to express attitudes toward social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with disease courtesy aids stigma stigmatization of people connected to issue of hiv aids or hiv positive people often aids stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas particularly those associated with homosexuality bisexuality promiscuity prostitution and intravenous drug use in many developed countries there is an association between aids and homosexuality or bisexuality and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice such as anti homosexual or anti bisexual attitudes there is also a perceived association between aids and all male male sexual behavior including sex between uninfected men however dominant mode of spread worldwide for hiv remains heterosexual transmission in 2003 as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation it became legal for people with aids to marry in china in 2013 u s national library of medicine developed a traveling exhibition titled surviving and thriving aids politics and culture this covered medical research u s government s response and personal stories from people with aids caregivers and activists economic

2012 hiv aids affects economics of both individuals and countries gross domestic product of most affected countries has decreased due to lack of human capital without proper nutrition health care and medicine large numbers of people die from aids related complications before death they will not only be unable to work but will also require significant medical care it is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million aids orphans many are cared for by elderly grandparents returning to work after beginning treatment for hiv aids is difficult and affected people often work less than average worker unemployment in people with hiv aids also is associated with suicidal ideation memory problems and social isolation employment increases self esteem sense of dignity confidence and quality of life for people with hiv aids anti retroviral treatment may help people with hiv aids work more and may increase chance that a person with hiv aids will be employed low quality evidence by affecting mainly young adults aids reduces taxable population in turn reducing resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to aids resulting in increasing pressure on state s finances and slower growth of economy this causes a slower growth of tax base an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating sick training to replace sick workers sick pay and caring for aids orphans this is especially true if sharp increase in adult mortality shifts responsibility from family to government in caring for these orphans at household level aids causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare a study in cote d ivoire showed that households having a person with hiv aids spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households this additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment religion and aids topic of religion and aids has become highly controversial in past twenty years primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to use of condoms religious approach to prevent spread of aids according to a report by american health expert matthew hanley titled catholic church and global aids crisis argues that cultural changes are needed including a re emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it some religious organizations have claimed that prayer can cure hiv aids in 2011 bbc reported that some churches in london were claiming that prayer would cure aids and hackney based centre for study of sexual health and hiv reported that several people stopped taking their medication sometimes on direct advice of their pastor leading to a number of deaths synagogue church of all nations advertised an anointing water to promote god s healing although group denies advising people to stop taking medication media portrayal one of first high profile cases of aids was american rock hudson a gay actor who had been married and divorced earlier in life who died on october 2 1985 having announced that he was suffering from virus on july 25 that year he had been diagnosed during 1984 a notable british casualty of aids that year was nicholas eden a gay politician and son of late prime minister anthony eden on november 24 1991 virus claimed life of british rock star freddie mercury lead singer of band queen who died from an aids related illness having only revealed diagnosis on previous day however he had been diagnosed as hiv positive in 1987 one of first high profile heterosexual cases of virus was american tennis player arthur ashe he was diagnosed as hiv positive on august 31 1988 having contracted virus from blood transfusions during heart surgery earlier in 1980s further tests within 24 hours of initial diagnosis revealed that ashe had aids but he did not tell public about his diagnosis until april 1992 he died as a result on february 6 1993 aged 49 therese s photograph of gay activist david kirby as he lay dying from aids while surrounded by family was taken in april 1990 life magazine said photo became one image most powerfully identified with hiv aids epidemic photo was displayed in life was winner of world press photo and acquired worldwide notoriety after being used in a united colors of benetton advertising campaign in 1992 criminal transmission criminal transmission of hiv is intentional or reckless infection of a person with human immunodeficiency virus hiv some countries or jurisdictions including some areas of united states have laws that criminalize hiv transmission or exposure others may charge accused under laws enacted before hiv pandemic in 1996 ugandan born canadian johnson aziga was diagnosed with hiv he subsequently had unprotected sex with 11 women without disclosing his diagnosis by 2003 seven had contracted hiv two died from complications related to aids aziga was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment misconceptions there are many misconceptions about hiv and aids three of most common are that aids can spread through casual contact that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure aids and that hiv can infect only gay men and drug users in 2014 some among british public wrongly thought one could get hiv from kissing 16 sharing a glass 5 spitting 16 a public toilet seat 4 and coughing or sneezing 5 other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between two uninfected gay men can lead to hiv infection and that open discussion of hiv and homosexuality in schools will lead to increased rates of aids a small group of individuals continue to dispute connection between hiv and aids existence of hiv itself or validity of hiv testing and treatment methods these claims known as aids denialism have been examined and rejected by scientific community however they have had a significant political impact particularly in south africa where government s official embrace of aids denialism 1999 2005 was responsible for its ineffective response to that country s aids epidemic and has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and hiv infections several discredited conspiracy theories have held that hiv was created by scientists either inadvertently or deliberately operation was a worldwide soviet active measures operation to spread claim that united states had created hiv aids surveys show that a significant number of people believed and continue to believe in such claims research hiv aids research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent treat or cure hiv aids along with fundamental research about nature of hiv as an infectious agent and about aids as disease caused by hiv many governments and research institutions participate in hiv aids research this research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education and drug development such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases hiv vaccines and antiretroviral drugs other medical research areas include topics of pre exposure prophylaxis post exposure prophylaxis and circumcision and hiv public health
