archeological finds of 1912 between germany and egypt according to secretary of german oriental company who was author of document and who was present at meeting borchardt wanted to save bust for us borchardt is suspected of having concealed bust s real value although he denied doing so berger p 288 while philipp vandenberg describes coup as adventurous and beyond comparison breger p 286 time

at back and an uraeus cobra over her brow which is now broken she also wears a broad collar with a floral pattern on it ears also have suffered some damage gardner s art through ages suggests that with this elegant bust thutmose may have been alluding to a heavy flower on its slender sleek stalk by exaggerating weight of crowned head and length of almost serpentine neck according to david silverman nefertiti bust reflects classical egyptian art style deviating from eccentricities of amarna art style which was developed in akhenaten s reign exact function of bust is unknown though it is theorized that bust may be a sculptor s modello to be used as a basis for other official portraits kept in artist s workshop colours ludwig borchardt commissioned a chemical analysis of coloured

discovered no piece of quartz to represent iris of left eyeball was present as in other eye and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of ps1000 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts borchardt assumed that quartz iris of left eye had fallen out when sculptor thutmose s workshop fell into ruin joyce a tyldesley nefertiti egypt s sun queen viking 1999 p 196 missing eye led to speculation that nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection and actually lost her left eye though presence of an iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility fred gladstone bratton a history of egyptian archaeology hale 1968 p 223 dietrich wildung proposed that bust in berlin was a model for official portraits and was used by master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve internal structure of eye and thus left iris was not added gardner s art through ages and silverman presents a similar view that bust was deliberately kept unfinished silverman wegner wegner pp 21 113 hawass suggested that thutmose had created left eye but it was later destroyed ct scans bust was first ct scanned in 1992 with scan

thutmose had added gypsum under cheeks and eyes in an attempt to perfect his sculpture wildung explained ct scan in 2006 led by alexander huppertz director of imaging science institute in berlin revealed a wrinkled face of nefertiti carved in inner core of bust results were published in april 2009 s radiology scan revealed that thutmose placed layers of varying thickness on top of limestone core inner face has creases around her mouth and cheeks and a swelling on nose creases and bump on nose are leveled by outermost stucco layer according to huppertz this may reflect aesthetic ideals of

public as part of egyptian museum of berlin bust created a sensation swiftly becoming a world renowned icon of feminine beauty and one of most universally recognised artifacts to survive from ancient egypt nefertiti bust was displayed in berlin s neues museum on museum island until museum was closed in 1939 with onset of world war ii berlin museums were emptied and artifacts moved to secure shelters for safekeeping nefertiti was initially stored in cellar of prussian governmental bank and then in autumn of 1941 moved to tower of a flak bunker in berlin neues museum suffered bombings in

displayed before war in 1967 nefertiti was moved to egyptian museum in charlottenburg and remained there until 2005 when it was moved to altes museum bust returned to neues museum as its centerpiece when museum reopened in october 2009 controversies requests for repatriation to egypt ever since official unveiling of bust in berlin in 1924 egyptian authorities have been demanding its return to egypt breger p p 116 in 1925 egypt threatened to ban german excavations in egypt unless nefertiti was returned in 1929 egypt offered to exchange other artifacts for nefertiti but germany declined in 1950s egypt again tried to initiate negotiations but there was no response from germany although germany had previously strongly opposed repatriation in 1933 hermann goring considered returning bust to king farouk of egypt as a political gesture hitler opposed idea and told egyptian government that he would build a new egyptian museum for nefertiti in middle this wonder nefertiti will be enthroned i will never relinquish head of queen while bust was under american control egypt requested united states to hand it over us refused and advised egypt to take up matter with new german authorities in 1989 egyptian president hosni mubarak viewed bust and announced that nefertiti was best ambassador for egypt in berlin dr zahi hawass former secretary general of egyptian supreme council of antiquities believes that nefertiti belongs to egypt and that bust was taken out of egypt illegally and should therefore be returned dr hawass has maintained stance that egyptian authorities were misled over acquisition of nefertiti in 1913 he has demanded that germany prove that it was exported legally according to kurt g siehr another argument in support of repatriation is that archeological finds have their home in country of origin and should be preserved in that country siehr pp 133 4 nefertiti repatriation issue sprang up again in 2003 over body of nefertiti sculpture in 2005 hawass requested unesco to intervene to return bust in 2007 hawass threatened to ban exhibitions of egyptian artifacts in germany if nefertiti was not lent to egypt but to no avail hawass also requested a worldwide boycott of loans to german museums to initiate what he calls a scientific war hawass wanted germany to at least lend bust to egypt in 2012 for opening of new grand egyptian museum near great pyramids of giza simultaneously a campaign called nefertiti travels was launched by cultural association based in hamburg germany they distributed postcards depicting bust of nefertiti with words return to sender and wrote an open letter to german culture minister bernd neumann supporting view that egypt should be given bust on loan in 2009 when nefertiti moved back to neues museum her old home appropriateness of berlin as bust s location was questioned several german art experts have attempted to refute all claims made by hawass pointing to 1924 document discussing pact between borchardt and egyptian authorities though as discussed earlier borchardt has been accused of foul play in deal german authorities have also argued bust is too fragile to transport and that legal arguments for repatriation were insubstantial according to times germany may be concerned that lending bust to egypt would mean its permanent departure from germany in december 2009 friederike seyfried director of berlin s egyptian museum and papyrus collection presented to egyptians documents held by museum regarding discovery of bust which include a protocol signed by german excavator of bust and egyptian antiquities service in documents object was listed as a painted plaster bust of a princess but in diary of ludwig borchardt he clearly referred to it as head of nefertiti this proves that borchardt wrote this description so that his country can get statue hawass commented these materials confirm egypt s contention that he did act unethically with intent to deceive however hawass said egypt didn t consider nefertiti bust to be a looted antiquity still it is one of a handful of truly singular egyptian antiquities still in foreign hands i really want it back he said hawass statement quoted director of museum as saying authority to approve return of bust to egypt lies with prussian cultural heritage and german culture minister associated press egypt antiquities chief to demand nefertiti bust allegations over authenticity french language book le de nefertiti une imposture de l bust of nefertiti a fraud in egyptology by swiss art historian henri stierlin and book missing link in archaeology by berlin author and historian erdogan ercivan both claimed that nefertiti bust was a modern fake stierlin claims that borchardt may have created bust to test ancient pigments and that when bust was admired by prince johann georg of saxony borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending prince stierlin argues that missing left eye of bust would have been a sign of disrespect in ancient egypt that no scientific records of bust appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery and while paint pigments are ancient inner limestone core has never been dated ercivan suggests borchardt s wife was model for bust and both authors argue that it was not revealed to public until 1924 because it was a fake another theory suggested that existing nefertiti bust was crafted in 1930s on hitler s orders and that original was lost in world war ii for pictures thumb in 1989 a 70 pfennig stamp which featured bust of nefertiti was on issue in germany dietrich wildung dismissed claims as a publicity stunt as radiological tests detailed computer tomography and material analysis have proved its authenticity pigments used on bust have been matched to those used by ancient egyptian artisans 2006 ct scan that discovered hidden face of nefertiti proved according to science news that bust was genuine egyptian authorities also dismissed stierlin s theory dr zahi hawass said stierlin is not a historian he is delirious although stierlin had argued egyptians cut shoulders horizontally and nefertiti had vertical shoulders hawass said that new style seen in nefertiti bust is part of changes introduced by akhenaten husband of nefertiti hawass also claimed that sculptor thutmose had created eye but it was later destroyed body of nefertiti in 2003 egyptian museum in berlin allowed hungarian artist duo little warsaw andras and balint havas to place bust atop a nearly nude female bronze for a video installation to be shown at venice biennale modern art festival project called body of nefertiti was according to artists an attempt to pay homage to bust according to wildung it showed continued relevance of ancient world to today s art however egyptian cultural officials took offence and proclaimed it to be a disgrace to one of great symbols of their country s history as a consequence they also banned wildung and his wife from further exploration in egypt for a picture of body of nefertiti see egyptian minister for culture farouk declared that nefertiti was not in safe hands and although egypt had not renewed their claims for restitution due to good relations with germany this recent behaviour was unacceptable cultural significance in 1930 german press described nefertiti bust as their new monarch personifying it as a queen as most precious stone in setting of diadem from art treasures of prussia germany nefertiti would re establish imperial german national identity after 1918 hitler described bust as a unique masterpiece an ornament a true treasure and pledged to build a museum to house it by 1970s bust had become an issue of national identity to both german states east germany and west germany created after world war ii breger p 291 in 1999 nefertiti appeared on an election poster for green political party 90 die as a promise for cosmopolitan and multi cultural environment with slogan strong women for berlin breger p 292 according to claudia breger another reason that nefertiti bust became associated with a german national identity was its place as a rival to tutankhamun found by british who then ruled egypt bust became an influence on popular culture with jack pierce s make up work on elsa lanchester s iconic hair style in film bride of frankenstein being inspired by it elizabeth young
