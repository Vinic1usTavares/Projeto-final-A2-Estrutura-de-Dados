terrorist and seductress matt santori praised chu s characterization as one that shatters any sense of caricature in ivy s persona and delivers a fully rounded living and breathing woman complex and fascinating comicbookwire concluded that on a whole series was an excellent examination into character comicbookwire also enjoyed murder mystery setup which made series accessible even for casual readers but found some of action in first half of series to be incredibly forced vox s alex abad santos thought that moments in issue 1 portraying ivy as a feminist avenging angel oversimplified character ign s jesse schedeen felt series was held back by lack of focus in its scripts series art received mixed reviews several critics were impressed by level of detail in clay mann s art with lindsey bass of org complimenting mann s use of negative space to highlight personal details in ivy s life reviewing issue 1 newsarama s pierce lydon and abad santos agreed that mann s strength was in drawing good looking people latter declared his gorgeous people are gorgeous however both wished that mann had been more adventurous with his panels some reviewers were critical of mann s highly sexualized highly objectifying depictions of women in series which comicosity felt severely undermined chu s writing in contrast bass review for issue 1 gave mann credit for ing a sexiness to poison ivy without it coming across as vulgar with various other artists also contributing to series comicbookwire and comic book resources were impressed by art s level of consistency on other hand ign s schedeen noticed a distinct difference in art styles while adventures in poor tastes gregory paul silber criticized wild inconsistency across issues ulises arreola was praised for his colors
