st helens recs had disbanded at end of 1938 39 season withdrawal of st helens recs required a change in way fixtures were organised with 28 clubs in league each club was a member of 14 team lancashire league or 14 team yorkshire league actual geographical split of clubs was 15 clubs based in yorkshire and 13 in lancashire so halifax played as a member of lancashire league each teams fixture list comprised a home and away fixture against all teams in their county league 26 as well as home and away fixtures against seven teams in other county league 14 for a total of 40 games with only 27 clubs league s secretary john wilson proposed a 36 game season for each club with halifax remaining in lancashire league and dewsbury who were lowest finishing yorkshire team in previous season playing as a member of neither county league for purposes of determining fixture lists dewsbury would be considered 14th team of both county leagues excepting dewsbury each team s fixture list would comprise other teams in their own county league 24 games together with six teams from other county 12 games dewsbury s opponents would be nine clubs from each county at league s annual general meeting on 7 june 1939 clubs accepted wilson s proposal regarding positions of halifax and dewsbury but voted for a 40 game fixture list instead of wilson s 36 game proposal fixture lists were issued later in june each team except dewsbury had home and away fixtures against all teams in their own county league 24 games they also had home and away fixtures against eight teams in other county league 16 games dewsbury s fixture list comprised home and away fixtures against 10 teams from each county league a full programme of games was played up to saturday 2 september by that date most clubs had played two or three games as some clubs had played midweek matches suspension of league on monday 4 september day after declaration of war all rugby league games and all other spectator sports and public entertainments were suspended by provisions of prohibition of public entertainments defence order one of numerous orders made following enactment of emergency powers defence act 1939 as a result some clubs like wigan and salford announced they were closing for duration of war and that their players were released one issue clubs had to consider was what to do with monies paid for season tickets holders of which may have only seen one or two games barrow for one resolved to repay season ticket holders less a deduction for games seen while oldham decided not to give any refunds stating we are up against it and must appeal to our members to make this sacrifice under defence regulations and air raid precautions all areas of country were designated as evacuation neutral or reception areas depending on assessment of an area as an enemy target and its ability to receive people from evacuation areas defence regulations allowed for resumption of sporting events within reception or neutral areas and on 9 september home secretary issued public entertainments restriction order allowing events to go ahead outside evacuation areas attendances were limited to 8 000 or 15 000 at grounds with a capacity over 60 000 on 11 september rugby league council agreed to clubs playing friendlies on following two saturdays while league secretary john wilson arranged a programme of games players were to be paid 10s per match and their travelling expenses while minimum entrance fee was set at 6d meeting also appointed a wartime committee to run league for duration of war seven games were played on 16 september and eleven on 23 september a further change in defence orders allowed games to go ahead in evacuation areas as long as consent of local chief constable had been obtained county competitions wilson s proposal which was accepted on 11 september was for league to run as two parallel county competitions a yorkshire competition and a lancashire competition under umbrella name of lancashire and yorkshire emergency period league leagues would be played on a simple home and away basis gate money was to be split equally between two clubs after deducting player expenses and travel expenses for 15 players of away club players expenses were limited to 10s per game plus meal expenses if they had to travel more than to an away game these allowances replaced any previous contractual arrangements between players and clubs and in effect removed professional status from players referees were to be allowed 10s plus travel expenses and touch judges 5s plus travel expenses players were also allowed to play for another club if that club was closer to home or work subject to agreement of their first club this was to alleviate travelling for players who worked away no inter competition games were planned but in january 1940 it was proposed and agreed that there should be a two legged final between winner of each competition to decide overall league champions clubs were asked to notify wilson as soon as possible if they intended to play in competitions in end all 27 clubs including those like salford and wigan who had previously decided to cease operating had entered when fixture list was issued rules also allowed alternative venues to be used if a club s home ground was unavailable either temporarily or permanently broughton rangers home ground belle vue was unavailable to them all season so they played at a variety of other grounds while salford and swinton shared swinton s station road player protest even before season started players at bradford northern halifax and huddersfield protested that expense limit of 10s per game was insufficient and that they would not play unless expenses were increased lord mayor of bradford t j robinson had anticipated players stance at a lunch for wartime committee he was reported as saying committee members would have difficulty in getting first class footballers used to getting ps4 or ps5 to accept remuneration of 10s per match but no doubt difficulties would be surmounted players most opposed to expense limit were those of bradford northern who were unanimous in their opposition and had made it clear to club secretary that they were not prepared to play for 10s per game secretary had informed wilson of this asking for a special meeting of clubs to discuss issue at this stage wilson did not consider discussion appropriate unless 20 or more of clubs requested it huddersfield players also informed their club committee that they were not prepared to play on following saturday at halifax secretary stated reports of a strike were exaggerated and that players were quite willing indeed they were anxious to play but they were not prepared to run risk of losing jobs they had got or of being off work for small amount they were permitted to receive chairman of rugby league council g f hutchins responded by asking all players to give 10s expenses a month s trial after which issue would be reviewed while players at st helens accepted 10s limit at barrow team selection for saturday was delayed because of issue while some clubs including halifax dewsbury and batley called for an increase in limit on friday 29 september halifax players agreed to play but remained dissatisfied by expense allowance bradford players remained adamant leaving club no alternative but to inform their opponents for saturday hull kingston rovers that game could not go ahead players from many clubs met on 2 october and agreed to continue to press issue with rugby football league but they would play on saturday in order to keep faith with public after second weekend of competitions rugby league council met to discuss expenses issue and agreed a doubling of expenses limit to ps1 expenses for referees were also increased to ps1 but touch judges expenses remained unchanged at 5s also clubs could make an additional payment of 5s to each player for away games played in barrow or hull due to extra travelling time needed to increase likelihood that gates would be adequate minimum entry for a game was increased to 1s but remained at 6d for women children and any uniformed members of armed forces players responded by welcoming rise but asked rugby league council to consider changing system to a payment of 25s to players on winning team and 15s to members of losing team players felt this would increase competitiveness in games wartime committee met following week but made no response to player s suggestion bonuses were not discussed further except at end of season when league awarded monetary prizes rather than medals yorkshire competition with 15 teams fixture list for yorkshire competition contained 28 fixtures for each team with season end date being 11 may until christmas 1939 competition progressed as planned although at least one game was concluded early hull v batley on 21 october was ended after 65 minutes due to an air raid warning last week of december 1939 was start of third coldest winter of 20th century and most severe in united kingdom since 1895 heavy snow and prolonged cold periods together with lack of material to protect pitches meant that after games

backlog of over 100 games built up and it became apparent that it would be impossible to complete fixtures by end of april without many midweek games being played decision was taken to extend season clubs were urged to complete their fixtures by 4 may but as backlog grew date was moved to 11 may with championship final scheduled for 18 and 25 may extension required a ballot of all clubs as games

outstanding hull f c had away fixtures against batley and keighley to play and hull kingston rovers were still to play dewsbury at home these games never were played as hull f c reported in july that their two fixtures were and both keighley and batley had withdrawn from yorkshire cup ending their seasons in may due to problems raising teams with two points awarded for a win non playing of these
