targeted film at dutch audiences which may account for focus on native customs and farming such coverage was unusual for contemporary works of fiction although documentaries had handled subject before his production house which handled film was bandung based carli some contemporary reviews erroneously gave house s name as cosmos film production began in late 1929 or early 1930 with scenes shot in west java and sumatra de stem des starred annie krohn carli s mixed race wife as annie as well as sylvain boekebinder van kempen vally lank and jan kruyt story was advertised as being adapted from novel of same name like all contemporary films produced in indies de stem des bloeds had low production values film was silent and in black and white final production consisted of 3 652 meters of film intertitles were in dutch which indonesian film historian misbach yusa biran notes that most viewers those who were native or ethnic chinese were unable to read in order to provide a semblance of colour carli tinted certain scenes entirely in one shade during post production for instance a scene where farmers were gathering rice was tinted violet release and reception thumb alt a newspaper advertisement center 600px newspaper advertisement surabaya de stem des bloeds was released in 1930 seeing its batavia now jakarta premiere on 22 march of that year by july it was being screened in surabaya east java it was reported to be a success with native audiences filling theatres in batavia and surabaya film received mixed critical reception an anonymous review in batavia based doenia film praised film s picture especially its colour and both krohn and boekebinder s acting a review in surabaya based de courant likewise praised film stating that it fascinates from beginning to end and showed that even in indies a grand film could be made however review criticised censorship bureau s failure to catch scenes of frederick drinking alcohol which reviewer found dangerous to prestige of dutchmen considering large native audiences kwee tek hoay writing in panorama criticised film extensively writing that it seemed meant exclusively for dutch audiences in netherlands as those living in indies would be able to see it did not reflect reality and was in places illogical he found colouring one extension of this lack of logic writing that a violet tinge indicated that farmers were harvesting rice at sunset something that never happened legacy carli went on to make two more films starring krohn first 1931 was a romance set on south coast of java which had krohn in titular role second karina s zelfopoffering karina s sacrifice followed following year this film saw krohn play a mixed raced woman living at palace in sultanate of yogyakarta karina s zelfopoffering was a commercial failure and carli left indies not long afterwards moving to netherlands he lived there until his death in 1972 writing in 2009 biran suggests that de stem des bloeds was clearly written from an indo point of view because of positive roles of indo children he finds film sympathetic to native culture including faithful njai he notes with interest that although in real life mixed race children were faced with a sense of disgust in de stem des bloeds an indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure dutch woman and fight with a dutchman film is likely lost american visual anthropologist
