thumb first issue of other worlds cover art by malcolm smith other worlds universe science fiction and science stories were three related us magazines edited by raymond a palmer other worlds was launched in november 1949 by palmer s clark publications and lasted for four years in its first run with well received stories such as enchanted village by a e van vogt and way in middle of air one of ray bradbury s martian chronicle stories since palmer was both publisher and editor he was free to follow his own editorial policy and presented a wide array of science fiction palmer entered a partnership with a chicago businessman in 1953 to create bell publications and printed universe science fiction from june 1953 palmer used new company to abandon other worlds and launch science stories in order to escape from clark publications financial difficulties hence science stories can be considered a continuation of other worlds science stories was visually attractive but contained no memorable fiction universe on other hand was drab in appearance but included some well received stories such as theodore sturgeon s world well lost which examined homosexuality a controversial topic for time palmer s chicago partner lost interest so he took over both science stories and universe science fiction under a new company in 1955 he culled both magazines and brought back other worlds numbering issues to make new magazine appear a continuation of both original other worlds and also of universe in this new incarnation magazine was less successful but did print marion zimmer bradley s first novel falcons of narabedla in 1957 palmer changed focus of magazine to unidentified flying objects ufos retitling it flying saucers from other worlds and after september 1957 issue no more fiction appeared palmer eventually settled on flying saucers mysteries of space age as title and in that form it survived until june 1976 publishing history jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep

palmer editor of amazing stories published i remember lemuria by richard shaver in march 1945 issue story about prehistoric civilizations explained all disasters on earth as work of evil robots palmer presented story as a mixture of truth and fiction and response from readers was strong enough that he bought more stories from shaver and promoted what he called shaver mystery circulation grew dramatically but publisher ziff davis became alarmed at ridicule stories were drawing in press and ordered palmer to tone down material palmer complied but planned to leave he formed his own publishing company clark publications in 1947 and launched fate in 1948 ashley 1985a pp 32 33 in 1949 palmer left ziff davis and launched other worlds science stories in digest format editor was listed as robert n webster a pseudonym palmer used to conceal his activities since he was still working at ziff davis when first issue appeared palmer had planned to distribute free copies of first issue to fans at that year s world science fiction convention in cincinnati printing delays meant magazine did not appear until late in year at convention palmer announced that robert n webster was his pseudonym and gave convention organizers original artwork for first issue for auction nadis 2013 p 145 he also met and immediately hired bea mahaffey a cleveland fan as his managing editor starting with fourth issue dated may 1950 ashley 1985c p 458 palmer planned another science fiction sf title imagination to be launched in fall of 1950 ashley 2005 p 10 but in june he suffered a serious accident and was temporarily paralyzed and mahaffey took over in his absence palmer was able to help with editing both magazines even while in hospital but by september he decided to sell imagination to william hamling and keep other worlds despite high cover price of 35 cents other worlds did well enough for palmer to increase publication frequency from bimonthly to every six weeks but faced competition from two new magazines launched at about same time magazine of fantasy science fiction first issue of which had appeared at end of 1949 and galaxy science fiction which published its first issue in october 1950 ashley 1985c pp 460 461 lawler 1985 p 290 both were very successful with higher budgets than palmer was able to afford and other worlds suffered as a result magazine was doing well enough for palmer to move it to monthly publication at end of 1952 it stayed on a regular schedule until july 1953 issue ashley 1985c p 462 but palmer s finances eventually worsened to point that he was unable to pay his printer casebeer 1985 p 692 jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec1953 1 21954 3 4 four issues of science stories showing issue number all four were edited

publications in partnership with businessman whose name was never revealed and starting two magazines universe science fiction and science stories universe s first issue appeared in june 1953 while other worlds was still being published it was financed by palmer s partner and intended as a bimonthly though in fact first four issues were on a quarterly schedule it was edited by palmer and mahaffey who used collective pseudonym george bell for first two issues casebeer 1985 p 694 science stories followed in october also edited by palmer and mahaffey as george bell and published by bell publications bousfield 1985 p 555 this was effectively same magazine as other worlds science stories with other worlds dropped from title in second issue of science stories palmer explained reason for new magazine for a variety of reasons and let s be honest most of them were financial we had to make a spur of moment decision to discontinue other worlds and replace it with magazine you are now reading we phoned typesetter halted work on august ow and lifted editorial and stories we needed for science stories no 1 from ow material on hand bousfield 1985 p 552 subscribers to other worlds were

issues when anonymous businessman lost interest in project palmer bought him out financed by sale of his half share in clark publications which had published other worlds and fate he founded palmer publications and took over new magazines with universe s third issue and science stories second issue and abandoned pseudonym ashley 1985c p 463 he launched mystic magazine which like fate published occult material both fact and fiction ashley 1985b p 417 science stories failed to sell well ashley 2005 p 62 and ceased to appear after april 1954 issue but universe continued going bimonthly after march 1954 issue a total of ten issues appeared under title universe science fiction and with may 1955 issue title other worlds science fiction reappeared ashley 1985c p 466 new version of other worlds initially carried both universe s numbering and issue numbering from original run of other worlds palmer closed offices in evanston illinois and edited magazine from his home in wisconsin mahaffey continued to work on magazine by mail from cincinnati from november 1955 format changed to pulp size this was against prevailing market winds as almost all pulps had died out by this time in 1956 an unexpected tax bill forced palmer to let mahaffey go and he ran magazine by himself from that point on ashley 1985c p 464 following year palmer switched magazine s focus to flying saucers to try to maintain existing readership while attracting new readers palmer emphasized sf and flying saucers in alternate issues for example june 1957 issue was titled flying saucers from other worlds and july issue was flying saucers from other worlds he also hoped that each issue would be kept longer on newsstands if distributors thought they were dealing with two magazines experiment did not last from july august 1958 issue title was shortened to flying saucers and magazine ceased to carry fiction ashley 1985c pp 464 465 ashley 2005 pp 184 185 ashley 2016 p 448 palmer retired to amherst wisconsin and took over its printing bibliographic sources focus on science fiction issues and do not index magazine after 1958 but it continued publication until 1976 as a non fiction magazine contents and reception thumb hannes bok cover for may 1951 issue of other worlds palmer s interest in shaver mystery did not abate when he left amazing stories and lead story for first issue of other worlds was shaver s fall of lemuria still presented as truth in guise of fiction cover illustration was by malcolm smith a frequent artist for amazing palmer declared in first issue that he wanted to present science fiction from across spectrum hard science stories of kind that appeared in astounding science fiction and stories representative of styles of other leading magazines amazing planet stories and thrilling wonder stories despite this many of stories in first issue were routine much of first issue s contents were by amazing regulars and it initially appeared that new magazine would not be very much different from palmer s amazing stories but within a few issues quality improved noticeably ashley 1985c pp 458 459 unlike almost every other sf magazine on market other worlds was edited and published by same person which meant there were no constraints on palmer s editorial policy he attempted to find new and daring material and in early years of magazine he obtained some of better stories being published mike ashley a historian of science fiction cites eric frank russell s dear devil portrait of a narcissus by raymond f jones way in middle of air one of ray bradbury s martian chronicles stories and two stories by a e van vogt enchanted village one of van vogt s best liked stories and war of nerves part of his voyage of space beagle series ashley 1985c pp 459 460 fritz leiber contributed seven black priests one of his fafhrd and gray mouser stories and e e smith who had become famous for his space operas switched to fantasy with which appeared in march 1953 issue poul anderson and gordon r dickson contributed heroes are made first in their series and palmer obtained fiction from other well known writers such as fredric brown and wilson tucker partly because of competition from newly launched galaxy science fiction and magazine of fantasy science fiction palmer was unable to obtain enough material of this quality to fill magazine and most of remaining stories were unremarkable space adventures ashley 1985c p 461 ashley 2005 pp 9 10 ashley comments that stigma of shaver mystery clung to palmer and damaged magazine and suggests that much of best quality work in other worlds was due to influence of mahaffey who in ashley s opinion had excellent taste in fiction ashley 2005 p 61 a high point of non fiction pieces was a series of articles by l sprague de camp abridged from his book lost continents atlantis theme in history which ran from 1952 to 1953 covers were attractive often with artwork on both covers by well known artists such as malcolm smith robert gibson jones harold mccauley and hannes bok left thumb cover of december 1953 science stories by virgil stories maintained same high quality of artwork first issue dated october 1953 was painted by bok who also did interior illustration for jack williamson s story based on cover remaining three covers were by virgil finlay albert a and jones wendy bousfield an sf historian considers last one best and also singles out last issue s interior illustrations all by finlay for praise writing was not up to standard of artwork with jack williamson and mack reynolds only two authors whose reputation has lasted a lower page count meant less non fiction material and readers departments such as letters in science stories than in other worlds but palmer found space for cartoons and advertisements for his own books such as coming of saucers written with kenneth arnold bousfield 1985 pp 552 554 science stories was visually attractive but lacked memorable story lines universe science fiction took opposite approach with uninteresting covers and poor interior artwork but it had substantial story lines in first two issues which sf historian e f casebeer attributes to mahaffey s influence murray leinster mark clifton and mack reynolds contributed to early issues with robert bloch providing constant reader theodore sturgeon and world well lost a treatment of homosexuality controversial for 1950s once palmer became more involved with magazine again artwork improved with finlay lawrence stevens and edd cartier contributing good interior illustrations in casebeer s view finlay and lawrence illustrations were best magazine had to offer and he considers quality of fiction to have gone downhill after a fairly promising start in last three issues artwork was also weak with poor quality black and white covers and little interior art casebeer 1985 pp 692 693 first issue of revived other worlds in may 1955 had a black and white cover picture later issues returned to colour though until 1956 these were all reprints of covers from first incarnation of magazine for cover of november 1955 issue first in pulp format palmer reprinted artwork by j allen st john from back cover of november 1952 issue st john s artwork had saved another palmer magazine fantastic adventures from cancellation in 1939 quality of fiction dropped from occasional highs of first run of other worlds falcons of narabedla first novel by marion zimmer bradley appeared in 1957 and palmer also bought her first darkover novel sword of though he never ran it and eventually returned manuscript to bradley palmer hoped to publish tarzan on mars a novel by stuart byrne that used fictional worlds created by edgar rice burroughs but he was unable to get authorization from burroughs estate and had to shelve idea palmer had long been interested in ufos and ran an article in other worlds in 1951 titled i flew in a flying saucer captain a v g though lester del rey reports in his history of sf magazines that it may have been written by palmer himself del rey 1979 p 162 eventually palmer decided to drop science fiction from june 1957 only three issues june july and september included fiction thereafter it was a nonfiction magazine about ufos he wrote in following issue that he would print news of flying saucers and rumors and would debunk any claims he could prove fake over next twenty years he included such fringe ideas such as that earth was not spherical and in december 1959 ran an article in flying saucers that claimed earth was shaped like a donut and that flying saucers originated from an unexplored source on earth s surface nadis 2013 pp 232 235 in 1965 palmer published an article by delmar h bryant that debunked idea that earth was hollow but
