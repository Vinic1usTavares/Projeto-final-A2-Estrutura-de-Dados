formally london necropolis national mausoleum company until 1927 was a cemetery operator established by act of parliament in 1852 in reaction to crisis caused by closure of london s graveyards in 1851 lnc intended to establish a single cemetery large enough to accommodate all of london s future burials in perpetuity company s founders recognised that recently invented technology of railway provided ability to conduct burials a long distance from populated areas mitigating concerns over public health risks from living near burial sites accordingly company bought a very large tract of land in brookwood surrey around from london and converted a portion of it into brookwood cemetery a dedicated railway line london necropolis railway linked new cemetery to city financial mismanagement and internal disputes led to delays in project by time brookwood cemetery opened in late 1854 a number of other cemeteries had opened nearer to london or were in process of opening while some parishes in london did arrange for lnc to handle burials of their dead many preferred to use nearer cemeteries lnc had anticipated handling between 10 000 and 50 000 burials per year but number never rose above 4 100 per year and in its first 150 years of operations only 231 730 burials had been conducted buying land for brookwood cemetery and building cemetery and railway had been very expensive and by time cemetery opened lnc was already on verge of bankruptcy lnc remained solvent by selling surplus parts of its land but as land had been chosen in first place for its remoteness sales were low from 1880s lnc began a more aggressive programme to maximise its income process for sale of surplus land was improved resulting in increased income lnc redeveloped its lands at hook heath woking into housing and a golf course creating a new suburb of woking and providing a steady income from rentals after an 1884 ruling that cremation was lawful in england lnc also took advantage of its proximity to woking crematorium by providing transport for bodies and mourners on its railway line and after 1910 by interring ashes in a dedicated columbarium lnc also provided land for a number of significant military cemeteries and memorials at brookwood after both world wars in 1941 london necropolis railway station lnc s london railway terminus was badly damaged by bombing and london necropolis railway was abandoned rising property prices in surrey in 1940s and 1950s made lnc increasingly valuable but also made it a target for property speculators in 1959 a hostile takeover succeeded and lnc s independence came to an end from 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners stripped profitable parts of business from company leaving a rump residual company operating increasingly derelict cemetery in 1985 what remained of company came into ownership of ramadan guney who set about reviving what remained links were formed with london s muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials and a slow programme of clearing and restoring derelict sections of cemetery commenced although it was never as successful as planned lnc was very influential in both funeral industry and in development of area around woking and brookwood cemetery remains largest cemetery in united kingdom background 300px thumb london churchyards were squalid and overcrowded existing graves were regularly exhumed to free burial space and unearthed remains left scattered alt a group of people gambling on a flat tombstone scattered human remains are strewn on ground around them since conversion of london to christianity in early 7th century city s dead had been buried in and around local churches with a limited amount of space for burials oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials and remains of previous occupants transferred to charnel houses for storage from 14th century onwards charnel houses themselves were overwhelmed and exhumed bones were scattered where they had been dug up or reburied in pits despite this practice by mid 17th century city was running seriously short of burial space a proposal by christopher wren to use reconstruction following 1666 great fire of london as an opportunity to cease burials in churchyards and establish new cemeteries outside city was approved by king and parliament but vetoed by corporation of london and burials continued at newly rebuilt churches in first half of 19th century population of london more than doubled from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851 despite this rapid growth in population amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately spread across around 200 small sites difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit available space and covered with a layer of earth in more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space in some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds unearthing previous burials and fresh corpses crammed into available space intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture coffin wood was burned as household fuel and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to north of england to be sold as fertiliser decaying corpses contaminated water supply and city suffered regular epidemics of cholera smallpox measles and typhoid in 1842 mean working life of a london professional man was 30 years and of a london labourer just 17 years public health policy at this time was shaped by miasma theory belief that airborne particles released by decaying flesh were primary factor in spread of contagious illness and bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern a royal commission established in 1842 to investigate problem concluded that london s burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one commissioner and sanitation campaigner edwin chadwick testified that each year 20 000 adults and 30 000 children were being buried in less than of already full burial grounds commission heard that one cemetery spa fields in clerkenwell designed to hold 1 000 bodies contained 80 000 graves and that gravediggers throughout london were obliged to shred bodies in order to cram remains into available grave space in 1848 49 a cholera epidemic killed 14 601 people in london and overwhelmed burial system completely bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials proposed solutions to burial crisis 400px thumb proposed solutions to burial crisis 1852 a ring of new cemeteries had opened outside built up area of london but were only a temporary solution edwin chadwick planned two large new cemeteries just outside boundaries of metropolitan burial district while promoters of necropolis scheme planned a single large cemetery far enough from

slightly further out a railway line runs from city to a single large cemetery to southwest a long way further out in wake of public concerns following cholera epidemic and findings of royal commission act to amend laws concerning burial of dead in metropolis burials act was passed in 1851 under burials act new burials were prohibited in what were then built up areas of london seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from london or were in process of opening and temporarily became london s main burial grounds a proposal by francis seymour haden to ship bodies of london s dead to thames estuary for use in land reclamation met with little approval and government sought alternative means to prevent constantly increasing number of deaths in london from overwhelming new cemeteries in same manner in which it had overwhelmed traditional burial grounds new suburban cemeteries had a combined size of just and board of health did not consider any of them suitable for long term use as a long term solution to crisis edwin chadwick proposed closure of all existing burial grounds in vicinity of london other than privately owned kensal green cemetery in west london kensal green cemetery was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west london a large tract of land on thames around southeast of london in abbey wood on site of present day thamesmead was to become a single burial ground for east london all bodies would be shipped by river and canal to new cemeteries bringing an end to burials in london itself treasury was sceptical that chadwick s scheme would ever be financially viable it also met with widespread public concerns about impact of monopoly control of burial industry and about government taking control of an industry previously controlled by religious bodies and private entrepreneurs process of decomposition was still poorly understood and it was generally believed that 92 of a decaying corpse is dispersed as gas local authorities in vicinity of proposed new cemeteries were horrified at prospect of an estimated per year of miasma disease carrying vapour spreading from cemeteries across surrounding areas although metropolitan interments act 1850 authorised chadwick s scheme to proceed metropolitan interment amendment act 1852 repealed authorisation richard broun and richard sprye while negotiations over state taking control of burials were ongoing an alternative proposal was being drawn up by richard broun and richard sprye broun and sprye intended to use emerging technology of mechanised land transport to provide a final solution to problem of london s dead they envisaged buying a single very large tract of land around from london in brookwood near woking surrey to be called brookwood cemetery or london necropolis at this distance land would be far beyond maximum projected size of city s growth greatly reducing any potential hazards from miasma in 18th century this land had been nicknamed waste of woking and with poor quality gravel soil it was of little use in farming and thus available very cheaply london and south western railway lswr which had connected london to woking in 1838 would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from london to site easily and cheaply broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains each carrying 50 60 bodies travelling from london to new necropolis in early morning or late at night and coffins being stored on cemetery site until time of funeral mourners would then be carried to appropriate part of cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during day thumb 450px broun and sprye s original necropolis proposal existing railway line was to separate main anglican cemetery foreground with large chapel and a wedge shaped plot of land divided into 36 small cemeteries for use of london s parish churches immediately behind main anglican cemetery parallel to railway line on southern side of railway from a number of smaller cemeteries on northern side of railway connected by a long curving road for use of roman catholics and nonconformist churches waterway meandering through northern cemetery is basingstoke canal although this design was abandoned in favour of a single larger site south of railway line and a new railway line to reach more distant parts of cemetery division into a northern unconsecrated and a southern anglican cemetery was retained alt a railway line runs through open countryside on one side of railway line is a formally arranged garden based around a building with a tall spire and on other are a number of small plots of land linked by a curving road broun calculated that a site would accommodate a total of 5 830 500 individual graves in a single layer legislation authorising brookwood cemetery did not permit mass graves at site and burials were restricted to one family per grave if practice of only burying a single family in each grave were abandoned and traditional practice for pauper burials of ten burials per grave were adopted site was capable of accommodating 28 500 000 bodies assuming 50 000 deaths per year and presuming that families would often choose to share a grave broun calculated that even with prohibition of mass graves it would take over 350 years to fill a single layer of cemetery although brookwood site was a long distance from london broun and sprye argued that railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than seven existing cemeteries all of which required a slow and expensive horse drawn hearse to carry body and mourners from london to burial site opposition shareholders in lswr were concerned at impact cemetery scheme would have on normal operations of railway at a shareholders meeting in august 1852 concerns were raised about impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of secrecy in which negotiations between lswr and promoters of cemetery were conducted lswr management pledged that no concessions would be made to cemetery operators other than promising them use of one train each day charles james blomfield bishop of london was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes arguing that noise and speed of railways was incompatible with solemnity of christian burial service blomfield also considered it inappropriate that families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train and felt that it demeaned dignity of deceased for bodies of respectable members of community to be carried on a train also carrying bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives meanwhile henry drummond member of parliament for west surrey constituency which covered brookwood site james mangles mp for nearby constituency of guildford and labour reform campaigner lord ashley later lord shaftesbury lobbied against proposal drummond considered scheme a front for land speculation believing that promoters only intended to use for cemetery and to develop remaining 80 for building mangles felt that people of woking were not being fairly compensated for loss of their historic rights to use common lands ashley felt that metropolitan interments act 1850 had been a victory for campaign to end private profiteering from death and that new scheme would reverse these gains and was also concerned about health implications of diseased bodies being transported to and stored at london terminus in large numbers while awaiting trains to brookwood formation of london necropolis company despite opposition on 30 june 1852 london necropolis national mausoleum act 1852 was passed giving brookwood scheme parliamentary consent to proceed former woking common at brookwood owned by earl of onslow was chosen as site for new cemetery to prevent lswr from exploiting its monopoly on access to cemetery private act of parliament authorising scheme bound lswr to carry corpses and mourners to cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic but did not specify details of how funeral trains were to operate by this time broun and sprye had lost control of scheme on 1 april 1851 a group of trustees led by poor law commissioner william voules purchased rights to scheme from broun and sprye for ps20 000 about ps in terms of consumer spending power and once act of parliament had been passed founded london necropolis national mausoleum company on their own without regard to their agreement with original promoters these trustees proved inept wasting large sums of money meanwhile richard broun lobbied vigorously against misrepresentations and ambiguous assertions of new trustees with financiers sceptical of scheme s viability voules and his trustees were unable to raise funds to buy proposed site from lord onslow in early 1853 amid widespread allegations of voting irregularities and with company unable to pay promised dividends a number of directors resigned including voules and remaining public confidence in scheme collapsed broun s scheme had envisaged cemetery running along both sides of lswr main line and divided by religion with separate private railway halts on main line each incorporating a chapel to serve each religion s section new consulting engineer to company william cubitt rejected this idea and recommended a single site to south of railway line served by a private branch line through cemetery company also considered broun s plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic arguing that relatives would not want coffins to be shipped separately from deceased s family brookwood cemetery

unanimously approved by shareholders and work finally began on scheme a tract of land stretching from woking to brookwood was purchased from lord onslow westernmost at brookwood end were designated initial cemetery site and a branch railway line was built from lswr main line into this section a plot of land between westminster bridge road and york street now leake street was chosen as site for london railway terminus architect william tite and engineer william cubitt drew up a design for a station which was approved in june 1854 and completed in october 1854 in july 1854 work began on drainage of marshlands designated as initial cemetery site and on construction of embankment carrying railway branch into cemetery with ambition to become london s sole burial site in perpetuity lnc were aware that if their plans were successful their necropolis would become a site of major national importance as a consequence cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind in contrast to squalid and congested london burial grounds and newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded lnc aimed to create an atmosphere of perpetual spring in cemetery and chose plants for cemetery accordingly it had already been noted that evergreen plants from north america thrived in local soil robert donald owner of an arboretum near woking was contracted to supply trees and shrubs for cemetery railway line through cemetery and major roads and paths within cemetery were lined with giant sequoia trees first significant planting of these trees only introduced to europe in 1853 in britain as well as giant sequoias grounds were heavily planted with magnolia rhododendron coastal redwood azalea andromeda and with intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout cemetery on 7 november 1854 new cemetery opened and southern anglican section was consecrated by charles sumner bishop of winchester at time it was largest cemetery in world on 13 november first scheduled train left new london necropolis railway station for cemetery and first burial that of stillborn twins of a mr and mrs hore of ewer street borough took place cemetery railway line as brookwood site had been intentionally chosen for its distance from london at time of its opening only practical way to reach cemetery was by railway william cubitt decided terrain of initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch from lswr at west of cemetery and work began on earthworks and rails for new branch in early september 1854 single track branch was completed in time for opening two months later junction with lswr known as necropolis junction was west facing meaning that trains to and from london were obliged to reverse in and out of branch to two stations in cemetery poor quality gravel soil which had been initial reason for site s cheapness and its selection as site for cemetery was poorly suited as a railway trackbed rails and

could be cheaply transported to terminus by water from much of london while being situated near three major thames bridges area was easily accessed from both north and south of river arches of huge brick viaduct carrying lswr into waterloo bridge station now london waterloo station were easily converted into mortuaries broun also felt that journey out of london from waterloo bridge would be less distressing for mourners while most of rail routes out of london ran through tunnels and deep cuttings or through densely populated areas at this time urban development of what is now south london had not taken place and lswr route ran almost entirely through parkland and countryside in march 1854 lnc purchased a plot of land between westminster bridge road and york street now leake street architect william tite and engineer william cubitt drew up a design for a station which was approved in june 1854 and completed in october of that year as station abutted arches of lswr s viaduct it acted as an obstacle to any increase in number of lines serving waterloo station renamed from waterloo bridge station in 1886 urban growth in area of what is now south west london through which trains from waterloo ran led to congestion at station and in 1896 lswr formally presented lnc with a proposal to provide lnc with a new station in return for existing station lnc agreed to proposals in return for lswr granting lnc control of design of new station and leasing new station to lnc for a token rent in perpetuity providing new rolling stock removing any limit on number of passengers using necropolis service and providing free carriage of machinery and equipment to be used in cemetery although lswr was extremely unhappy at what they considered excessive demands in may 1899 companies signed an agreement in which lswr gave in to every lnc demand in addition lswr paid ps12 000 compensation about ps in terms of consumer spending power for inconvenience of relocating lnc station and offices and agreed that mourners returning from cemetery could travel on any lswr train to waterloo vauxhall or clapham junction a site for replacement terminus was bought by lswr in 1899 south of existing site and on opposite side of westminster bridge road new station was completed on 8 february 1902 and lswr viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged waterloo station destroying all traces of original lnc terminus cemetery rail stations two stations in cemetery were very similar in design north station served nonconformist section of cemetery and south station served anglican section on william cubitt s advice two stations in cemetery were built as temporary structures in expectation that they would need to be rebuilt once railway was operational and issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer other than brick platform faces chimneys and foundations stations were built entirely of wood each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners a first class and an ordinary refreshment room and a set of apartments for lnc staff to provide an attractive first view of cemetery for visitors arriving at stations areas around stations and their associated chapels were planted with groves of bay cedar of lebanon rhododendron and portuguese laurel at time cemetery opened nearest railway station other than those on cemetery branch was woking railway station away as only one train per day ran from london to cemetery stations and back and even that ran only when funerals were due to take place access to cemetery was difficult for mourners and lnc staff although in negotiations leading to creation of cemetery lswr had told lnc that they planned to build a main line station near cemetery they had not done so on 1 june 1864 lswr finally opened brookwood railway station on their main line immediately adjacent to cemetery a substantial commuter village grew around northern i e non cemetery side of new station burials london necropolis company offered three classes of funerals a first class funeral allowed its buyer to select grave site of their choice anywhere in cemetery at time of opening prices began at ps2 10s about ps in terms for a basic with no special coffin specifications it was expected by lnc that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following funeral second class funerals cost ps1 about ps in terms and allowed some control over burial location right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings about ps in terms if a permanent memorial was not erected lnc reserved right to re use grave in future third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals those buried at parish expense in section of cemetery designated for that parish although lnc was forbidden from using mass graves other than burial of next of kin in same grave and thus even lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for deceased third class funerals were not granted right to erect a permanent memorial on site families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial but this practice was rare despite this brookwood s pauper graves granted more dignity to deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of period all of which other than brookwood continued practice of mass graves for poor brookwood was one of few cemeteries to permit burials on sundays which made it a popular choice with poor as it allowed people to attend funerals without need to take a day off work as theatrical performances were banned on sundays at this time it also made brookwood a popular choice for burial of actors for same reason to extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of cemetery near station entrance thumb third class coffin ticket issued between april september 1925 alt railway ticket labelled southern railways london necropolis coffin ticket waterloo to brookwood third class while majority of burials conducted by lnc around 80 were pauper funerals on behalf of london parishes lnc also reached agreement with a number of societies guilds religious bodies and similar organisations lnc provided dedicated sections of cemetery for these groups on basis that those who had lived or worked together in life could remain together after death although lnc was never able to gain domination of london s funeral industry for which its founders had hoped it was very successful at targeting specialist groups of artisans and trades to extent that it became nicknamed westminster abbey of middle classes a large number of these dedicated plots were established ranging from chelsea pensioners and ancient order of foresters to corps of commissionaires and lswr nonconformist cemetery also includes a parsee burial ground established in 1862 which remains only zoroastrian burial ground in europe dedicated sections in anglican cemetery were also reserved for burials from those parishes which had made burial arrangements with lnc immediately after its foundation lnc used existing firms of london undertakers to arrange funerals but over time took over all aspects of arrangements from coffin making to masonry lnc funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers with exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a hearse on being commissioned to provide a funeral invitations would be sent out either by deceased s family or from lnc offices these letters specified waiting room to be used time of train to brookwood and expected return time to london if funeral was to be held in london a traditional hearse and carriage would take deceased to their parish church for service and then on to london railway terminus if funeral was to take place in terminus or in brookwood procession would come directly to terminus funerals on arrival at terminus mourners would be led either to one of dedicated first class waiting rooms for first and second class funerals or to communal third class waiting room coffin would be discreetly unloaded from hearse and sent to platform level by lift those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch coffins being loaded onto train if they so wished after relocation to new london terminus in 1902 some funeral services would be held in a chapelle ardente on platform level for those cases where mourners were unable to make journey to brookwood each door of waiting train would be labelled with name of deceased to ensure all passengers travelled with correct funeral party names of deceased being carried on train would be called in turn and that person s mourners would board train at time service was inaugurated lnc s trains were divided both by class and by religion with separate anglican and nonconformist sections of train this distinction applied to both living and deceased passengers intended to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in same compartment rather than to provide different facilities carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design and primary difference was different ornamentation on compartment doors at 11 35 am 11 20 am on sundays train would leave london for brookwood arriving at necropolis junction at 12 25 pm 12 20 pm on sundays thumb north station in 1907 alt a train on a single rail track near a small white wooden station on arrival at north or south station coffins would usually be unloaded onto a hand drawn bier and pulled by lnc staff to appropriate chapel while this was taking place mourners were escorted to waiting rooms at station on arrival at chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service third class funerals had a single service in appropriate chapel for all those being buried for those burials where funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or lnc s london terminus coffins would be taken directly from train to grave return trains to london generally left south station at 2 15 pm and necropolis junction at 2 30 pm return journey initially took around an hour owing to need to stop to refill engine with water but following construction of water tower in cemetery this fell to around 40 minutes an 1854 agreement between lnc and lswr gave consent for lnc to operate two or three funeral trains each day if demand warranted it but traffic levels never rose to a sufficient level to activate this clause train ran only if there was a coffin or passengers at london terminus waiting to use it and both journey from london to brookwood and later return would be cancelled if nobody was due to leave london that morning it would not run if there was only a single third or second class coffin to be carried and in these cases coffin and funeral party would be held until next service generally trains ran direct from london to cemetery other than occasional stops to take on water between 1890 and 1910 trains also sometimes stopped at vauxhall and clapham junction for benefit of mourners from south west london who did not want to travel via waterloo but these intermediate stops were discontinued and never reinstated after 1 october 1900 sunday trains were discontinued and from 1902 daily train service was ended and trains ran only as required on some occasions where there were very large numbers of mourners lswr would provide special passenger trains from waterloo to their own station at brookwood to carry additional mourners to vicinity of cemetery as well as intending to conduct those burials which would previously have taken place in london s now closed graveyards lnc also envisaged physical relocation of closed burial grounds to their necropolis to provide a final solution to problems caused by burials in built up areas massive london civil engineering projects of mid 19th century railways sewer system and from 1860s precursors to london underground often necessitated demolition of existing churchyards first major relocation took place in 1862 when construction of charing cross railway station and routes into it necessitated demolition of burial ground of cure s college in southwark around of earth was displaced uncovering at least 7 950 bodies these were packed into 220 large containers each containing 26 adults plus children and shipped on london necropolis railway to brookwood for reburial along with at least some of existing headstones from cemetery at a cost of around 3 shillings per body at least 21 london

renamed necropolis continued to operate until 2002 developments and difficulties thumb rate of burials by lnc was much lower than anticipated and around 80 of graves are unmarked making brookwood distinctively uncluttered when compared to other cemeteries alt grassy area lined with giant sequoia trees with occasional scattered gravestones success of lnc relied on taking over all or at least a significant portion of burials of london s dead however while metropolitan interment amendment act 1852 had repealed chadwick s scheme for two very large cemeteries near london it had also permitted london s parishes to make their own arrangements for burial of their dead each parish could make arrangements with cemetery of its choosing or use money from rates to create their own cemeteries financial mismanagement and internal disputes within lnc had delayed opening of brookwood cemetery by 18 months and during this period new cemeteries nearer london had opened or were nearing completion while some parishes did choose brookwood as their burial site many preferred either to make arrangements with less distant cemeteries or to buy land on outskirts of london and open their own suburban cemeteries concerns over financial irregularities and viability of scheme had led to only 15 000 of 25 000 lnc shares being sold severely limiting company s working capital and forcing it to take out large loans buying land from lord onslow compensating local residents for loss of rights over woking common draining and landscaping portion to be used for initial cemetery and building railway lines and stations were all expensive undertakings with far fewer burial contracts with london parishes than had been anticipated by time brookwood cemetery opened in november 1854 lnc was on verge of bankruptcy recognising their financial predicament lnc lobbied parliament for a new act of parliament to allow venture to survive on 23 july 1855 london necropolis national mausoleum amendment act 1855 received royal assent this act released lnc from those compulsory purchases of land which had been mandated by 1852 act but had not yet been completed easing immediate financial burden it also allowed a ten year window for lnc to sell certain parts of land bought from lord onslow which were not required for cemetery to provide a source of income although 1855 act permitted lnc to sell land this proved difficult of site around were occupied by initial necropolis site and adjacent reserve site and a further retained their common land rights and could not be developed in any way rendering them worthless to prospective buyers while this left theoretically able to be sold brookwood site had been chosen for its remoteness and there were few prospective buyers while were bought by government as sites for prisons and a lunatic asylum lnc struggled to sell remainder by time ten year window for land sales expired in 1865 only had been sold with majority of surplus lands still unsold as ten year window expired lnc successfully petitioned for a further five year extension lnc was by this time in serious financial difficulties and dependent on loans from its own directors to settle outstanding debts business had been established on basis that cemetery would handle between 10 000 and 50 000 burials per year but number never exceeded 4 100 and over its first 20 years of operations averaged just 3 200 as five year extension expired financial difficulties remained and under pressure from shareholders london necropolis national mausoleum amendment act 1869 was passed this removed all restrictions on land sales other than within existing cemetery and adjacent reserve site despite releasing of restrictions in 1869 act land sales remained disappointing by 1887 less than half surplus land had been sold much of it at very low prices cremation in 1878 cremation society of great britain bought an isolated piece of lnc s brookwood land and built woking crematorium on site crematorium was completed in 1879 but richard cross home secretary bowed to strong protests from local residents and threatened to prosecute if any cremations were conducted as a consequence crematorium was not used other than for experimental incineration of livestock 1884 trial of william price established that human cremation was not unlawful in england and on 26 march 1885 first human cremation took place at woking although lnc was hostile to idea of cremation woking crematorium was only operational crematorium in country since necropolis railway provided easiest way to transport bodies and mourners from london to woking area transport to and from woking crematorium soon began to provide a significant source of revenue for lnc thumb brookwood columbarium built as a

tubbs recognised that a potential increase in cremations once practice became accepted represented an opportunity for lnc in july 1891 he proposed that lnc build its own crematorium and columbarium building for storage of cremated remains within cemetery with ultimate goal of taking over all funeral arrangements for cremation society cremation society were keen to prevent a competitor to woking

more expensive lswr fares to transport coffins and mourners from waterloo to woking giving lnc a significant advantage in carriage to crematorium while lnc never built its own crematorium in 1910 lord cadogan decided he no longer wanted to be interred in mausoleum he had commissioned at brookwood this building largest mausoleum in cemetery was bought by lnc fitted with shelves and niches to hold urns and used as a dedicated columbarium from then on cyril tubbs thumb as they were unable to find an agent for sale of their surplus land at hook heath lnc themselves developed area into a prosperous suburb of large detached houses alt very large white gabled house in december 1887 lnc appointed cyril tubbs to supervise lnc estate tubbs was given a broad remit to advance company s interests including buying and selling land supervising railway stations advertising cemetery and liaising with lswr tubbs set about restructuring design of brookwood cemetery to make it more appealing to mourners and visitors cemetery was divided into numbered sections separated by an expanded network of avenues these avenues were all named and signposts were erected along them to allow visitors easily to find their way around sprawling brookwood site and to locate particular graves naming and numbering system devised by tubbs has remained in use ever since tubbs established a masonry works and showroom near centre of cemetery allowing lnc to provide grave markers without difficulty of shipping them from london and opened a lnc owned nursery in grounds for sale of plants and wreaths this increased practice of mourners planting flowers and shrubs around graves which was in turn used by lnc in their promotional material to promote brookwood as a garden of sleep in around 1904 masonry works was expanded and equipped with a siding from railway branch line allowing lnc to sell its gravestones and funerary art to cemeteries nationwide tubbs also oversaw a restructuring of ailing programme to sell lnc s surplus lands estate was partitioned into three sections and separate estate agents appointed to oversee disposal of each many of lands near woking railway station and around brookwood were sold at much higher prices than lnc had previously fetched no suitable agent could be found to oversee sale of third portion of lnc land hook heath and as a consequence tubbs kept it under lnc control and oversaw its development himself over 1890s site was subdivided into plots for large detached houses and a golf course was built to attract residents and visitors thumb brookwood memorial unveiled by queen elizabeth ii in final months of lnc independence is considered one of most important war memorials in uk alt open white stone circular structure supported by broad columns carrying inscribed tablets in august 1914 on outbreak of first world war lnc offered to donate to war office of land for free interment of soldiers and sailors who have returned from front wounded and may subsequently die offer was not taken up until 1917 when a section of cemetery was set aside as brookwood military cemetery used for burials of service personnel who died in london district in 1921 this area was sold to imperial war graves commission later commonwealth war graves commission and since then military cemeteries have been administered and maintained by iwgc cwgc and its equivalents for other nations whose military are buried there in september 1922 lnc sold an area adjacent to military cemetery to us government lnc was hired by us government to landscape this area and build a chapel creating american military cemetery later brookwood american cemetery and memorial only burial ground in britain for us casualties of first world war although built by lnc since 1923 american military cemetery has been administered by american battle monuments commission after second world war military cemeteries were extended to include dedicated sections for many of allied nations and in 1958 brookwood memorial commemorating 3 500 commonwealth casualties of second world war with no known grave was dedicated at site between them military cemeteries occupy around of site closure of london necropolis railway on 13 april 1927 cyril tubbs died after almost 40 years as surveyor general manager and later a director of lnc shortly afterwards during meetings of lnc s shareholders on 16 june and 14 july 1927 words national mausoleum were formally dropped from lnc s name company being officially renamed london necropolis company on 28 december 1927 george barratt who had worked for lnc for 63 years and been superintendent of brookwood cemetery for 41 years also died although number of burials was gradually declining it remained relatively steady however by this time mechanical had begun to affect numbers of people using london necropolis railway trains still ran to cemetery when there was demand but service which had previously operated almost every day was now generally running only around twice a week by now trees planted by lnc in its early years of operations were mature and brookwood cemetery was becoming a tourist attraction in its own right often featuring in excursion guides of 1920s and 1930s 300px thumb immediate aftermath of bombing of lnr s london terminus in april 1941 as seen from first class platform alt a railway platform strewn with rubble broken girders jut out above platform while alongside platform a set of railway lines stop abruptly at a large crater next to railway line is a burned out railway carriage tilted at an acute angle during second world war waterloo station and nearby thames bridges were a significant target for bombing and there were several near misses on station during london blitz of 1940 41 although there were several interruptions to necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on line necropolis station was undamaged during early stages of bombing campaign during night of 16 17 april 1941 in one of last major air raids on london this good fortune came to an end as bombs repeatedly fell on waterloo area rolling stock parked in necropolis siding was burned and railway arch connecting main line to necropolis terminus was badly damaged multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck central section of terminus building while lnc s office building and station platforms survived central section of station was reduced to rubble on 11 may 1941 station was officially declared closed southern railway sr which had absorbed lswr in 1923 offered lnc temporary use of waterloo station to allow necropolis railway service to be continued but refused to allow lnc to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling to and from cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day meaning those visiting cemetery had little reason to choose lnc s irregular and infrequent trains to cemetery stations over sr s fast and frequent services to brookwood lnc attempted to negotiate a deal by which genuine mourners could still travel cheaply to cemetery on 11 57 am service to brookwood sr service closest to lnc s traditional departure time but sr management themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage refused to entertain any compromise in september 1945 following end of hostilities directors of lnc met to consider whether to rebuild terminus and reopen london necropolis railway although main line from waterloo to brookwood had remained in use throughout war and was in good condition branch line from brookwood into cemetery had been almost unused since destruction of london terminus with soil of cemetery causing branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained branch line was in extremely poor condition although richard broun had calculated that over its first century of operations cemetery would have seen around five million burials at a rate of 50 000 per year at time last train ran on 11 april 1941 only 203 041 people had been buried at brookwood in almost 87 years of operations increased use of motorised road transport had damaged profitability of railway for lnc and faced with costs of rebuilding cemetery branch line building a new london terminus and replacing rolling stock damaged or destroyed in air raid directors concluded that past experience and present changed conditions made running of necropolis private train obsolete in mid 1946 lnc formally informed sr that westminster bridge road terminus would not be reopened decision prompted complicated negotiations with sr over future of lnc facilities in london in december 1946 directors of two companies finally reached agreement railway related portions of lnc site waiting rooms caretaker s flat and platforms themselves would pass into direct ownership of sr while remaining surviving portions of site office block on westminster bridge road driveway and ruined central portion of site would pass to lnc to use or dispose of as they saw fit lnc sold site to british humane association in may 1947 for ps21 000 about ps in terms of consumer spending power and offices of lnc were transferred to superintendent s office at brookwood sr continued to use surviving sections of track as occasional sidings into 1950s before clearing what remained of their section of site while most of lnc s business was now operated by road an agreement on 13 may 1946 allowed lnc to make use of sr services from waterloo to brookwood station for funerals subject to condition that should service be heavily used sr british railways after 1948 reserved right to restrict number of funeral parties on any given train although one of lnc s hearse carriages had survived bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used and coffins were carried in luggage space of sr s coaches coffins would either be shipped to brookwood ahead of funeral party and transported by road to one of mortuaries at disused cemetery stations or travel on same sr train as funeral party to brookwood and be transported from brookwood station to burial site or chapel by road although lnc proposed to convert cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from brookwood station through cemetery this never took place rails and sleepers of branch were removed in around 1947 and trackbed became a dirt road and footpath run around loop and stub of branch line west of brookwood station remained operational as sidings before being dismantled on 30 november 1964 after closure of branch line buildings of two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks and were renamed north bar and south bar on retirement in 1956 of a mr and mrs dendy who operated north bar from 1948 to 1956 and lived in station apartment north station was abandoned and demolished in 1960s owing to dry rot south bar continued to operate as a refreshment kiosk end of lnc independence after 1945 cremation up to that time an uncommon practice became increasingly popular in britain in 1946 lnc obtained consent to build their own crematorium on a section of nonconformist cemetery which had been set aside for pauper burials but chose not to proceed instead in 1945 lnc began construction of glades of remembrance a wooded area dedicated to burial of cremated remains these were dedicated by henry campbell bishop of guildford in 1950 intentionally designed for informality traditional gravestones and memorials were prohibited and burials were marked only by small stones although at its founding lnc had hoped to handle 50 000 burials per year and even without being granted a monopoly on london burials had planned for 10 000 per year brookwood cemetery was never as popular as hoped at time of railway s closure only 203 041 burials had been conducted and rate was steadily falling on lnc s 150th anniversary in november 1994 a total of 231 730 burials had been conducted even with unusually large individual grave sites offered by lnc for even cheapest burials site had been planned to accommodate 5 000 000 burials and much of land was empty despite decline in burials from an already low level rising land values in post war years meant that lnc was a valuable and successful company in 1940s it bought out a number of other firms of funeral directors particularly those catering for expanding and prosperous suburbs of south west london within easy reach of brookwood by road lnc continued to lobby sr and its 1948 successor british railways until 1950s on matter of cheap fares for visitors to cemetery but were unable to come to any agreement in 1957 southern region of british railways considered allowing lnc to sell discounted fares of 7s 6d compared to standard rate of 9s 4d for return tickets for same day travel from london to brookwood and back by this time most visitors to cemetery were travelling by road lnc felt that relatively minor difference between fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to railway and proposal was abandoned thumb acts regulating lnc did not let it build on reserve site and thus cyril tubbs converted it into west hill golf course act of 1956 allowed its sale but by this time golf course was well established and was not redeveloped after sale alt golf course owing to henry drummond s concerns in 1852 that lnc was a front for land speculation sale of lnc owned land for building had been expressly forbidden by act of parliament establishing lnc and consequently much of land not in use for burials remained undeveloped aside from land sold in 1850s and 1860s and areas sold by cyril tubbs by 1950s with area around woking by this time heavily populated rental income from lnc s land holdings was an extremely valuable asset and in may 1955 alliance property company launched a hostile takeover bid with aim of using cemetery s land for property development bid failed but prompted lnc to secure passing of london necropolis act 1956 allowing sale of all remaining surplus land a new company brookwood estates realisation company was founded to oversee disposal of remaining unsold lands as well as cemetery reserve finally formally recognising that brookwood cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries former south station was near road making it one of most easily accessed parts of cemetery once railway had closed and land surrounding it was now redundant as part of london necropolis act 1956 lnc obtained parliamentary consent to convert disused anglican chapel of 1854 into a crematorium using a newer chapel built by cyril tubbs in 1908 09 for funeral services and station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations suffering cash flow problems and distracted by hostile takeover bid lnc management never proceeded with scheme repeated takeover bids from various companies were unsuccessfully attempted in 1956 and 1957 until in december 1957 alliance property announced that it controlled a majority of shares of brookwood estates realisation company in january 1959 alliance property announced successful takeover of london necropolis company itself bringing over a century of independence to an end after takeover thumb in decades following demise of lnc much of cemetery began to revert to wilderness alt very overgrown cemetery historically lnc had invested much of its income from burials and fares and used dividends from these investments to pay for cemetery upkeep although alliance property kept name london necropolis company for its funeral business it was a property developer with no interest in funeral industry and saw little reason to spend large amounts maintaining cemetery proceeding with proposed crematorium or promoting new burials of bodies or cremated remains rising popularity of cremation meant rate of burials was at a historic low while victorian character of cemetery had fallen out of fashion income from burials was insufficient to maintain cemetery grounds and cemetery began to revert to wilderness over course of 1960s most undertaking work at brookwood came to an end after alliance property s land sales london necropolis company had been reduced to brookwood cemetery itself and frederick w paine a kingston upon thames firm of funeral directors which had been bought by lnc in 1947 in 1970 alliance property sold lnc to cornwall property holdings ltd following year cornwall property sold it on to great southern group owners of streatham park cemetery south london crematorium and a chain of funeral directors in central london great southern group dismantled much of what remained of company frederick w paine was detached from lnc along with specialist division overseeing exhumation and relocation of existing burial grounds to allow property development on formerly consecrated sites all that remained of lnc was brookwood cemetery itself by this time moribund and becoming heavily overgrown considered virtually worthless great southern sold lnc to property speculators maximillian investments in july 1973 for ps400 000 legacy thumb former superintendent s office which served as lnc s office from 1947 to 1975 alt medium size red brick building as alliance property and great southern group had between them stripped all assets other than cemetery itself and development within cemetery was prohibited lnc had little apparent value however maximilian investments secured passage of brookwood cemetery act 1975 authorising them to sell land within operational area of cemetery former superintendent s office housing lnc s offices near level crossing where necropolis railway had passed between northern and southern cemeteries was sold for office development following sale offices of lnc renamed brookwood cemetery ltd at this time were moved into a small former caretaker s lodge with little storage space in new makeshift offices majority of lnc s records were destroyed during move tracts of land within cemetery were sold to various religious groups and to wealthy families for use as private burial grounds and a tract of unused land south of glades of remembrance was sold to woking clay pigeon club masonry works remained operational until early 1980s although not under lnc management after early 1960s and were then converted into office buildings and named stonemason s court although act of 1975 had specified that a portion of profits from land sales be used to maintain remaining cemetery little restoration work was done and cemetery continued to revert to wilderness with new owners of land interested only in redeveloping those parts of cemetery not currently in use cemetery itself sank further into neglect thumb remains of south station in 2011 building in foreground is 1854 anglican chapel platform now forms part of boundary of monastery on former station site alt gabled building with a railway platform behind it last operators of refreshment kiosk in former south station retired in late 1960s and from then on station building was used as a cemetery storeroom around half building was destroyed by fire in september 1972 building was popular with railway and architectural enthusiasts as a distinctive piece of victorian railway architecture but despite a lobbying campaign to preserve surviving sections of station remaining buildings other than platform itself were demolished shortly afterwards by time of its demolition temporary structure was 118 years old in 1982 as part of programme of land sales station site two derelict anglican chapels and of land around it were sold to st edward brotherhood an order of russian orthodox monks brotherhood set about restoring chapels for religious use original 1854 chapel is used as a visitor s centre and living quarters for monastery while larger anglican chapel built by cyril tubbs in 1908 09 immediately north of station is now russian orthodox church of st edward martyr and houses relics and shrine of edward martyr king of england from 975 978 ad main monastery has been built on site of former station building while platform itself remains intact and now marks boundary of monastic enclosure in march 1985 company was bought by ramadan guney whose family owned cemetery until it was purchased by woking borough council in december 2014 guney family embarked on a programme of building links with london s mosques to encourage new burials in cemetery guney began a slow programme of clearing overgrown sections of cemetery and restoring significant memorials guney family s efforts to attract new custom have been successful to extent that some of lands sold off in 1970s have now been repurchased by cemetery in june 1989 cemetery was designated a conservation area and was subsequently declared a site of special scientific interest in 1992 brookwood cemetery society was formed to improve awareness of cemetery society holds open days guided walks and other events restores damaged memorials and maintains and improves signage within cemetery it is with these intentions that woking borough council agreed at a special council meeting on 24 november 2014 that it should secure cemetery by establishing woking necropolis and mausoleum limited as a subsidiary within its group of companies while it was never as successful as planned london necropolis company had a significant impact on funeral industry and principles established by lnc influenced design of many other cemeteries worldwide village of brookwood has grown on northern non
