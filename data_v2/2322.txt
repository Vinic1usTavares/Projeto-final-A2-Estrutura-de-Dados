writer of episode wanted to try a different approach to x files 175px thumb left writing and casting when vince gilligan wrote hungry he wanted to write a different episode that was told from viewpoint of monster and featured mulder and scully as antagonists series creator chris carter applauded this idea and called resultant episode a really great monster show shapiro p 42 gilligan s intention was for monster to be relatable and resonate with audience he later said my intention was that at end when mulder and scully show up and kill monster to have audience out there hoping that they would not show up shapiro p 43 chad donella was cast as lead monster because he possessed a subtle interesting quality according to casting director rick millikan director kim manners latter described donella as a great little actor duchovny s stunt double steve kiziak played role of private detective also called steve kiziak that roberts kills and eats kiziak later said it was a lot of fun to be in front of camera kiziak had first appeared as duchovny s body double in third season episode 2shy gradnitzer and pittson pp 88 89 and would later appear as a mulder lookalike in fight club shapiro p 243 filming and location as both david duchovny and gillian anderson were filming movies return to me and house of mirth respectively when season seven entered into production network decided to film hungry before any of other episodes despite fact that it would be aired third after sixth extinction arc this allowed duchovny and anderson to film their scenes and complete their movies with relatively little hassle several of finished scenes show mulder and scully together but many of these scenes were created with stand ins and doubles because of stars busy schedules duchovny and anderson were only available for two combined days of filming for this episode when designing sets for hungry production team found lucky boy burger restaurant to be relatively easy to create originally restaurant was supposed to be named but restaurant location that was considered ideal for filming had a lucky boy sign that could not be removed later design department faced a challenge in creating roberts apartment because script did not give a detailed account of what it was to look like broadcast and reception hungry first aired in united states on november 21 1999 this

paul goebel of tv squad listed rob roberts among his favorite x files monsters rich rosell from digitally obsessed awarded episode 3 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that episode features a great setup but climax leaves usual open ended questions zack handlen on a v club called episode perfectly acceptable and awarded it a b he was pleased with episode s unique format calling it a good gimmick that made an otherwise forgettable at best episode had it been constructed in typical fashion of x files into a memorable one he was also positive towards episode s use of humor noting that it is very much on target handlen however felt that story showed series tiredness and did not possess much suspense to keep watcher completely engaged paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four she noted that episode suffers from a syndrome that has afflicted a great many x files episodes in recent seasons syndrome consists of audience finding out early on who guilty party is vitaris however did note that episode s saving grace was vince gilligan s satiric writing tone she called scene featuring roberts hallucinating that burgers he was frying were actually brains sick but hilarious other reviews were more negative kenneth silber from space com was critical of episode noting that although change in perspective was unique and interesting this bit of originality does not rescue episode from a familiarity bordering on mundane it s not first time we have seen genetic mutants who have an affinity for human body parts tom kessenich in his book examinations gave episode a relatively negative review despite noting that episode wasn t a horrible entry for x files kessenich was unhappy with characterization of rob roberts as well as fact that killer was revealed very quickly kessenich pp 91 92 footnotes bibliography external links hungry at tv com category 1999 american television episodes category television episodes set in california
