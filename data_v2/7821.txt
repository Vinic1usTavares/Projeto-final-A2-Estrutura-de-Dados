season managing only six victories pinnacle of team s season was certainly giro d italia john gadret one of team s leaders won undulating 11th stage to castelfidardo though he was outclassed by race s truly elite riders particularly so by giro champion alberto contador he finished race in fourth place overall easily best final placing in a grand tour in team s history hubert dupont also rode very strongly in this race to 12th place overall and some high stage placings as well while team got several top tens in single day races from anthony ravard only such race they and he actually won was

season at chateauroux classic where he raced as defending champion and took his third career win in event ravard won a large field sprint a victory which he felt validated his career he had been considering retirement due to a medical abnormality as a muscle in his left leg is twice size of same muscle in his right team also had good showings from nocentini at grand prix cycliste de montreal ninth place mondory at grand prix de la somme second place montaguti at gran premio industria e commercio di prato third place bouet at tour de vendee third place and roche at giro del piemonte fifth

after a full field sprint mondory took stage win and ravard assumed overall race leadership since he had also finished second in first stage ravard also took lead in points classification with two further top ten placings later on ravard ended race by winning both overall and points titles though he briefly lost both for a stage squad finished on same time as for teams classification but dutch team won award thanks to a second place finish on final and most difficult stage of tour mediterraneen peraud finished in that same position overall it was not until much later in season that team took their other victories in august ravard won a stage at tour du poitou charentes s top sprinter at front of a field sprint so fast that first ten riders to finish opened up a three second time gap on rest of field in october at new tour of beijing roche took team s final win of season he along with philip deignan and chris froome had broken away on final climb of stage 3 from finish line and managed to stay away from fast charging peloton by a single second roche won three up sprint team had a small measure of success winning lesser classifications at stage races doing so at etoile de besseges giro del trentino tour de suisse route du sud paris correze and tour du poitou charentes team also sent squads to tour de san luis tour down under volta ao algarve three days of west flanders paris nice tirreno adriatico volta a catalunya tour of basque country circuit de la sarthe tour de romandie circuit de lorraine bayern criterium du dauphine eneco tour tour du limousin and circuit franco belge but did not achieve a stage win classification win or podium finish in any of them grand tours giro d italia thumb right alt a road racing cyclist wearing a white jersey stylised with blue and brown diamonds and brown shorts john gadret won a stage and finished fourth overall in giro easily best overall grand tour finish for both gadret and team ag2r s squad for giro d italia had as its leader gadret 13th place finisher in 2010 giro who aimed to improve upon that placing and ride to a top ten finish dessel and nocentini were named to squad to aim for stage wins and breakaway representation team s showing in stage 1 team time trial was mediocre at best as they came home 16th of 23 teams 49 seconds off winning pace set by montaguti finished near front of field in giro s first two road races taking tenth in mass sprint finish to stage 2 and likewise tenth in stage 3 when field was a little more split up gadret tried to bridge to leader on road martin kohler in stage 5 one of that stage s many dirt road sections but he experienced mechanical trouble and finished well down on day losing almost a minute to race s top riders gadret lay in 26th place after eight stages which was eve of race s first summit finish at mount etna gadret was ninth on etna losing over a minute to stage winner new race leader and eventual giro champion alberto contador but only 17 seconds to race s other top riders and he put in time to vast majority of field ride moved him up 11 places in overall standings gadret showed his best form and cunning in stage 11 with contador suggesting that he may tactically surrender jersey on this stage expectation was that victor would come from a member of morning breakaway instead team mounted a strong chase to bring breakaway riders back their leader michele later admitted that he had hoped to be day s winner but gadret took diminished peloton by surprise with a well timed attack on stage s final kilometer to claim first grand tour stage win of his career gadret and dupont then showed climbing prowess in first of three consecutive high mountain stages that preceded second rest day while contador and jose rujano were easily strongest riders on day ag2r tandem broke away from peloton behind and secured third and fourth positions on day gadret was third which afforded him a time bonus in addition to actual time taken this moved him into top ten for first time in race in eighth dupont also entered top ten after this stage at tenth place with sixth place next day on monte and attrition to other riders gadret moved up further to fifth place dupont finished eighth on this stage to move up to eighth overall gadret gained further time against vast majority of field in giro s queen stage stage 15 by finishing fifth and moving up to fourth place in overall standings dupont struggled coming in 22nd on day to fall to 15th overall gadret finished race in fourth place holding it after each of remaining stages dupont took back a little time against some of other riders in field in stages 17 and 20 to improve his final position to 12th gadret s fourth place was team s best overall placement in a grand tour in their history bettering sixth place attained by cyril dessel in 2006 tour de france tour de france gadret rode both giro and tour in 2010 an arrangement which resulted in some controversy when he refused to grant roche squad s leader for race his wheel after irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time this coupled with gadret s recuperation after extremely difficult giro and his admission that he prefers italian grand tour in any event led to speculation as to whether two would both be named to squad he claimed he would ride only to support roche if he rode at all lavenu stated that gadret s impressive giro had grown his standing with team and that feud between him and roche had been forgotten so he hoped gadret would ride tour confident of his recovery abilities gadret did indeed start tour team had only modest accomplishments in tour they had another mediocre performance in team time trial coming in 13th of 22 teams this time around hinault contested four sprint finishes in first half of tour but did not pose a serious challenge for victory in any of them with fourth place in stage 3 his best result before stage 11 gadret withdrew from race due to fatigue stemming from giro he had been in 66th place 25 09 behind race leader thomas voeckler roche lay 13th at this point 3 45 down he entered top ten next day despite losing time since attrition to other riders moved him up to tenth place he lost significant time in stage 14 on plateau de beille however ceding six minutes to race s top riders and falling to 18th however this stage also revealed peraud as a rider to watch he finished with elite group which lost time to just three riders and vaulted from 19th in overall classification up to 12th peraud s position held steady for next three days in stages won by sprinters and breakaways in stage 18 which finished at col du galibier peraud finished a modest 16th but this result moved him into top ten overall he dropped back out of top ten next day on alpe d huez by finishing 12th and sufficiently behind pierre rolland that younger frenchman took his place but regained tenth overall next day in grenoble thanks to his super time trial skills he held tenth next day to finish as team s best placed rider roche s final position was 26th vuelta a espana again following pattern of 2010 roche also rode vuelta as ag2r s squad leader he hoped to improve upon both his dismal tour which he admitted was hampered by a crash sustained shortly beforehand at criterium du dauphine and his seventh overall in 2010 vuelta their performance in third grand tour team time trial of season was even worse than first two as they were a paltry 19th of 22 immediately putting roche 42 seconds off pace roche led peloton across finish line in stage 3 but since it was for fifth place after breakaway riders took all time bonuses it had no substantial effect on his overall placing roche showed strongly on de jaen climb in stage 5 finishing just 7 seconds behind stage winner joaquim rodriguez however since this final climb was rather short time gaps were small throughout field and this performance only gained roche one place in overall standings moving him up to 25th stage 8 proved largely similar as rodriguez again won on a short steep final climb and roche finished in top ten on day 15 seconds back this time he gained two places with this ride mondory contested two of field sprints in race s first week but did not come particularly close to winning either finishing eighth and then seventh in stages 2 and 7 respectively montaguti found a successful breakaway in stage 11 taking sufficient mountains points to earn blue polka dotted jersey for two days he eventually finished second in classification roche also found a winning break in second half of vuelta joining 19 others to finish 1 33 ahead of main field in stage 13 this result moved him up to 14th overall mondory and montaguti took further high stage placings in stages 16 and 18 respectively though both were with a time gap to day s winner roche slipped slightly in last few stages of race to finish 16th falling well short of his goal to improve upon his placing in 2010 vuelta season victories
