siege of minerve was a military engagement which took place in june and july 1210 during albigensian crusade it was undertaken by catholic kingdom of france against cathars in southern france who were regarded as a heretical sect crusaders led by french nobleman simon de montfort besieged and captured town crusaders allowed soldiers defending town along with any catholics and cathars who had not yet reached status of perfect to go free three cathar perfects who repented were pardoned but 140 others who refused to do so were burnt at stake background albigensian crusade was initiated by kingdom of france at behest of pope innocent iii its purpose was to squash growing cathar movement which flourished mainly in languedoc region of southern france immediate cause was killing of papal legate pierre de castelnau crusaders set out in summer of 1209 after several military victories they were able to capture many towns without a fight before arriving at minerve after fall of carcassonne papal legate arnaud amalric who had led troops during massacre at beziers was replaced as commander of crusader force by simon de montfort 5th earl of leicester although amalric continued to accompany army minerve was a well fortified city it was located at confluence of and brian rivers which had cut deep ravines in nearby area it was also one of largest cities in languedoc situated near mediterranean coast minerve was a small castra deep in mountains and thus not of major strategic importance to military however it had become an important place of refuge for cathar and taking it would thus increase authority of both simon as count and catholic church in area which seems to have influenced simon s decision to attack city siege in early june crusader army besieged minerve town was commanded by lord guilhem de minerve unable to feed his army exclusively from agricultural area around town simon imported supplies from areas many miles away such as carcassonne steep gorges surrounding town made it virtually impossible to storm however gorges were also very narrow making a bombardment more practical simon realized this and decided to use his artillery to capture minerve crusaders relied effectively upon siege equipment simon made his headquarters east of town where a crew lobbed heavy objects into walls of town on west a rock thrower called a trebuchet was used in one of its earliest appearances in europe this machine named mala bad bombarded town very heavily partially destroying s home and towards end of june destroying main wall of city defenders held on for several more weeks but occupants began to run low on water on july 22 city surrendered laurence marvin calls simon s techniques an example of a skillful use of siege warfare to take castles in geographically hostile conditions simon and guilhem de minerve agreed to terms of surrender however amalric who had been absent at time returned to camp he insisted that no agreements could be considered binding without assent of himself as papal legate simon wished to treat occupants leniently but amalric wanted them put to death eventually two worked out a solution crusaders allowed soldiers defending town as well as catholics inside of it to leave cathars who had not yet reached status of perfect were also allowed to go free cathar perfects were given choice to return to catholicism or face death this solution angered many of soldiers who had wanted to participate in a massacre amalric calmed them by insisting that majority of perfects would not recant his prediction was correct soldiers entered town singing te deum while cathars segregated male and female knelt in prayer abbot guy of vaux de cernay began to preach catholic faith to men he was interrupted and told we will have none of your faith we have renounced church of rome your labor is in vain for neither death nor life will make us renounce opinions that we have embraced abbot then went to women who even more stubbornly refused to convert simon also urged both groups to abandon their cathar faith be converted to catholic faith simon said gesturing to collection of dry wood that had been assembled he continued or ascend this pile ultimately only three women repented 140 people who refused were burned at stake some cathars chose to jump freely into flames rather than wait for their executioners cistercian monk peter of vaux de cernay records two miracles which allegedly took place during siege of minerve in one instance a spring from which very little water flowed began to gush water shortly after crusaders arrived for siege afterwards it was reduced once again to a trickle in other as crusaders were leaving they set fire to all huts which they had made out of branches and dry leaves one hut in which a priest had said mass while in close proximity to others was somehow spared from flames aftermath after cathars had been burnt their bodies were buried in shallow mud graves crusaders continued their campaign against cathars capturing many more towns siege of termes came directly after references bibliography secondary sources primary sources category 13th century in europe minerve
