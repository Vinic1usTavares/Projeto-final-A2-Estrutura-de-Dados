production a single blade of grass is first episode of millennium to have been written by kay reindl and erin maher pair would pen two further episodes in second season and another in third season episode was only contribution to series by director rodman flender episode featured return of black s near psychic visions a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in second season executive producer glen morgan begrudgingly allowed maher and reindl to show ability in this episode saying i felt last year those visions were a cheat camera would go to a coffee cup and frank would say murderer used a coffee cup it drove me nuts what we were trying to do this year was elevate frank s visions to a dream like state so he would have to interpret what he s seeing there would be more mystical symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what s going on i had wanted to strip away gift for a long time and see if show really played without it but we got back into that
