east lancashire railway operated from 1844 to 1859 in historic county of lancashire england it began as a railway from clifton via bury to rawtenstall and during its short life grew into a complex network of lines connecting towns and cities including liverpool manchester preston and blackburn during a period of rapid growth company acquired several of its competitors including blackburn and preston railway which it purchased to gain access to preston it faced competition from companies such as north union railway and was involved in a notable stand off in 1849 with lancashire and yorkshire railway following several years of discussions east lancashire railway was in 1859 amalgamated with lancashire and yorkshire railway parts of network remain in use today and a section of original line between bury and rawtenstall is now operated as a heritage railway history manchester and bolton railway in 1830 manchester bolton bury canal company began to promote construction of a railway along line of their canal from salford to bolton and bury following an act of parliament to enable them to become a railway company they built their line from manchester to bolton although on a slightly different alignment than was first planned this was mainly to preserve canal for use of mine traffic which would not have been provided for if canal had been infilled and replaced by a railway a new act had been required for new alignment but due mainly to objections of company s engineer connection to bury was never built as it would have required a tunnel on a gradient of 1 in 100 at time a difficult and expensive proposition new railway therefore became known as manchester and bolton railway manchester bury and rossendale railway on 14 september 1843 a group of local businessmen including john grundy thomas wrigley and john robinson kay met at a public house in bury to discuss creation of a railway connection for bury and rossendale districts their proposed railway offered better facilities than those also proposed by manchester and leeds railway m lr whose planned connection at bury would be made with their heywood branch line from castleton manchester bury and rossendale railway company mb rr was thus created its purpose to build a railway from bury to clifton where it would connect to manchester and bolton railway company also promoted idea of extending line northwards to rawtenstall on 4 july 1844 their private 8 vict c 60 was granted royal assent act authorised company to raise ps300 000 and also to borrow ps100 000 ps and ps respectively in land between clifton and bury partly owned by earl of derby john robinson kay william grant and others was mostly waste woodland pasture or reservoirs except at where arable land was avoided by tunnel strong financial support was offered to mb rr by local businesses who were unhappy with idea of m lr building their own railway manchester and leeds district board of trade produced a report in 1845 which gave their backing to m lr and line was sanctioned in 1846 however mb rr project was unaffected by this connection left thumb upright inspector general of railways sir charles pasley surveyed line between clifton junction and rawtenstall and was reported to be highly pleased manchester contractors pauling who tendered ps167 529 ps in were in may 1844 awarded two contracts to build clifton to bury and bury to rawtenstall sections of new railway work was sub let to smaller contractors and began quickly in july 1844 manchester guardian wrote a favourable report on works however a shortage of workers in 1845 reflecting amount of railway construction underway at that time meant that some men were asked to work on sundays resulting in some being charged with breaking sabbath

direct link between blackburn and colne a second bba cer act allowed it to lease or sell itself to mb rr and so in 1845 two companies joined mb rr later that year changed its name to east lancashire

liverpool and bury railway at walton on hill to a junction with b pr enabling act also allowed lo pr to build further branch lines and elr obtained further acts including one which allowed it to build a connection to preston following acquisition on 3 august 1846 a disagreement ensued over traffic priorities and arrangements for elr at nur s station in preston elr proposed a new station and a separate line with a new crossing of ribble but this proved controversial preston corporation petitioned against proposed line producing a series of witnesses who attested to damage they presumed would be caused by embankment necessary for scheme to proceed several members of corporation were also shareholders of rival fleetwood preston and west riding junction railway and petition s proposer was brother in law to a director of rival manchester and leeds railway in end elr won its bid but had to landscape its embankment which later became dividing line between avenham and miller parks make an ornamental arch for carriages and pedestrians crossing under railway and build a footbridge on river viaduct meanwhile former mb rr line from clifton to rawtenstall was inaugurated on friday 25 september 1846 surveyed two days earlier by inspector general of railways charles pasley who was reportedly satisfied with project upwards of 1 000 invitations were delivered to local people shareholders and other interested parties they gathered at new hunts bank station in manchester leaving manchester train stopped near philips park to collect chairman john hodges before continuing to radcliffe bridge to collect more passengers large crowds were gathered along course of railway in bury train was extended to about 30 carriages and three engines and more passengers were collected before train finished its journey in rawtenstall passengers were provided with a large meal in a closed off section of a power loom shed owned by john robinson kay they listened to several celebratory speeches before re embarking train to head home railway was opened to general public on following monday in november 1846 company submitted proposals for a new line from buckley wells south of bury through whitefield and prestwich to a new terminus at victoria station plan did not progress any further than initial planning stages whitefield and prestwich eventually got their own railway stations in 1879 in two years elr grew from a company authorised to build of railway into one with authority to build of railway in february 1848 with of track open company reported for week ending 5 february 1848 an annual income of 18s 8d ps in for passengers and parcels and 10s 4d for freight ps in almost double previous year s income by march 1848 line between rawtenstall and newchurch was complete followed in june by blackburn to accrington connection and in august stubbins junction to accrington section line was extended east to burnley by september 1848 and in february 1849 from burnley to colne where it made an end on junction with leeds and bradford extension railway providing elr with a connection to bradford and leeds lo pr line to lostock hall was completed on 2 april 1849 and extension into preston station opened on 2 september 1850 line ran into new platforms built on east side of nur s station which were managed and staffed by elr and which had their own booking hall and entrance new platforms were effectively a separate station more lines followed with a connection between newchurch and bacup by october 1852 and ormskirk to rainford skelmersdale branch in march 1858 a three mile long line to tottington opened in 1882 from a junction with original mb br line it was electrified in 1913 before reverting to steam in 1951 it closed to passengers in 1952 and goods in 1963 and has since been reclaimed as a walkway clifton junction in 1846 manchester and bolton railway whose line elr used to gain access to manchester was taken over by manchester and leeds railway 9 10 vict c 378 which following year became part of lancashire and yorkshire railway l yr elr s expansion and opening of new routes including an alternative route between manchester and leeds had caused a degree of consternation at l yr but two companies initially managed to work together successfully after about three years a dispute flared up over collection of tolls for elr s use of line elr had become accustomed to running their trains on to l yr line and then later declaring of number of passengers liable for a toll but in march 1849 l yr insisted that elr trains stop at clifton so that passenger numbers and tickets could be checked by their own employees elr accused l yr of trying to impede their traffic particularly as they had recently gained a connection to bradford in competition with l yr they stated that l yr had access to their accounts and to returns made by their staff on morning of 12 march 1849 despite presence of police from bury and pendleton l yr placed a large baulk of timber across elr s line at clifton junction effectively blocking it employees from both companies arrived at scene and a large crowd gathered to watch events unfold l yr also pulled a train past junction blocking up line to city its engine was pointed south east toward manchester available to any elr passengers who wished to continue their journey an elr train arrived from bury and stopped l yr employees attempted to take tickets from elr s passengers but were refused as elr had already taken tickets at their ringley road station elr employees then removed baulk of timber and in an effort to push l yr train out of way drove their train forward l yr had anticipated this and moved another engine taken from a l yr train from manchester to front of their manchester bound train elr then blocked l yr down line with another of their trains laden with stone moving it to a position directly abreast of l yr train line remained completely blocked until about mid day with a queue of trains from both companies and from blackburn and darwen railway building up on each side of blockage situation was eventually defused when l yr withdrew their train general manager of elr richard hacking wrote to times newspaper expressing his annoyance at l yr s tactics he claimed to have received a letter from company sent on 9 march 1849 informing him of proposed changes to operational procedures resulting from a near collision at clifton junction first change was that elr trains would at all times give way to l yr trains on manchester and bolton line a stop signal was to be placed along elr line from junction to be activated whenever a l yr train was in sight second change was that for safety of public all elr trains would be required to stop before points at junction where all passenger tickets to manchester would be collected by l yr employees a daily return would be required of all passengers and other freight booked from salford for purpose of keeping regularly and balancing punctually accounts of two companies hacking claimed to have replied stating that near collision had occurred because l yr s engine driver had ignored a signal at clifton junction and that elr would not accept changes requested by l yr elr refused to supply tickets at any point although they considered it reasonable to supply more information on their traffic using l yr line centre

pedestrians hacking stated that he had received a letter from l yr porter at clifton requesting that all elr trains stop at clifton junction so that tickets could be collected by l yr staff and that all elr goods trains would have to supply invoices at junction in his letter he concluded that purpose of l yr s demands was to impede flow of elr traffic to manchester and onwards to yorkshire hacking s account of events of 12 march is similar to that reported by times he claims to have travelled to clifton to witness an l yr clerk being prevented from collecting tickets and to have then continued on another train to manchester on his arrival there he saw l yr employees ready to pull up rails to elr platform although rails were left intact he then mentions returning to clifton after hearing that l yr employees had recently left for station he blamed managing director of l yr captain law and mr blackmore superintendent of bolton line for ordering to be blocked with baulk of timber hacking also mentions an approaching up train from bolton which on encountering blockage apparently moved across to down line to bypass it in face of oncoming traffic expressing his shock he claims to have ordered elr s stone train onto down line changing signals accordingly hacking s account ends by claiming that blackmore ordered l yr train to move effectively resolving dispute right thumb lms stanier class 5 4 6 0 approaching summerseat station on heritage east lancashire railway matter was so serious that it was raised in house of commons it was eventually settled in court with elr thereon making a pro rata payment according to distance travelled on each railway court also found in favour of l yr who had argued that original agreement to share line did not extend to a vastly extended elr network amount of compensation to l yr was left at discretion of both companies relations between two companies were therefore not entirely amicable in 1853 elr made further proposals for a new line from clifton to salford roughly parallel to l yr line however in 1854 an agreement between two companies meant that clifton junction to salford line was vested jointly in both companies amalgamation had been discussed since early 1850s and in 1859 by an act of parliament elr was absorbed by l yr closure and legacy thumb right ringley road station is on a popular route for pedestrians cyclists and horse riders following beeching axe parts of elr s network were closed original mb rr line between clifton junction and bury closed in 1966 although radcliffe bridge station was closed in 1958 but line between bury and rawtenstall continued to serve passengers until 1972 and freight until 1980 this section is now used by east lancashire railway a modern heritage railway opened in 1987 trackbed between clifton and radcliffe now forms a part of irwell sculpture trail connection from stubbins to accrington was closed in 1966 elr line across ribble between preston and bamber bridge was closed to passengers in 1968 and to goods four years later east lancashire platforms 10 13 were demolished along with butler street goods yard line between preston and colne survives as east lancashire line operated by northern skelmersdale branch was closed to passengers in 1956 and to all traffic seven years later marshall j 1981 forgotten railways north west england david charles publishers ltd newton abbott p 93 however a proposal exists to reopen line as far as skelmersdale services between liverpool and ormskirk are now operated by merseyrail locomotives elr used a range of locomotives one of its earliest orders was for twelve long boiler 2 2 2s from fenton craven and company at least one of these was used on inauguration of railway but dissatisfied with locomotives they accepted only four four were diverted to leeds dewsbury and manchester railway and two to eastern counties railway in 1848 elr s four 2 2 2s were rebuilt as 2 4 0s by r and w hawthorn in about 1858 they were again rebuilt as 0 6 0s by sylvester lees richard walker a director of elr between 1838 and 1854 was supplier of about twenty locomotives to company including in 1850s four 2 4 0s and several 0 6 0s walker richard brother supplied four 2 2 2 locomotives medusa hecate diomed and lynx all were later rebuilt as a 2 4 0 tank engine in 1847 two 0 4 2s were supplied by r and w hawthorn rebuilt in 1868 as 2 4 0s in 1845 mb rr ordered four 0 6 0s from haigh foundry and a fifth engine from fenton craven and company another engine was built by haigh in 1848 largest elr class was a series of outside frame 2 4 0s with cylinders and driving wheels some may have originated as 2 2 2s and some were later rebuilt as 2 4 0 tank engines one was rebuilt as a 2 4 0 saddle tank engine these were among last locomotives to be built in bury other manufacturers to supply elr were sharp roberts and company stothert slaughter and company and beyer peacock and company elr livery for passenger locomotives was dark green with red brown frames and polished domes and safety valves infrastructure station buildings right thumb ormskirk railway station in 1915 station buildings generally followed one of three designs principal stations at bury and accrington were based on same design by a manchester based firm of architects most of other stations were designed by company s resident engineer they were stone built and consisted of a station master s room adjoining a seated waiting area a ladies waiting room and booking office third and cheapest design followed standard design but utilised brick and timber as materials platform was normally roofed signals track signals were based on two designs station signals on posts each post with two moveable arms and portable signals flags were used by day and coloured lanterns at night signals on posts were patented semaphore designs from j stevens son each post had two arms linked by chain to a foot control at base which were used to alert drivers on both up and down lines each foot control was held in place by a hook on post an arm set at an angle would indicate that train should approach slowly before stopping at station same arm set vertically and out of sight would indicate that train could pass through without stopping posts were also illuminated to allow use at night signals at accrington station were more complex linked to station building with wires and by default set at stop when released coloured lanterns used as portable signals were painted red on one side stop green on another go slowly and clear on third proceed rails line was standard gauge and most sections used rails in lengths each weighing 75 lb yard 31 1 kg m fixed to wooden sleepers long and apart accidents in early history of railways accidents were not uncommon and elr was no exception several incidents were reported in times during whitsuntide 1849 a passenger train was in a rear end collision with an excursion train near burnley lancashire despite efforts to protect rear of passenger train another excursion train was in a rear end collision with it in january 1850 three people died when a luggage train ran into a passenger train at maghull railway station a serious accident occurred at clifton junction on 19 october 1851 when a passenger train derailed passing points on junction injuring several passengers some seriously in september 1866 a man died after jumping from train from blackburn a non fatal collision occurred at lostock hall railway station in november 1876 inclement weather was also a problem in january 1867 trains were delayed for several hours at due to snow on line and on 30 january 1877 a heavy storm blew roof completely away from preston railway station references notes bibliography
