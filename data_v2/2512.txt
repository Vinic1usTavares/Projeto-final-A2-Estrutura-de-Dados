pencil thin moustache margarine coated hair and pork pie hat and young lennon called him twitchy because of a physical tic nervous cough julia s family and friends remembered that he also had a fiery temperament which could result in his being violent when drunk lennon remembered seeing his mother during a visit to mimi s when her face was bleeding after being hit by dykins paul mccartney later
