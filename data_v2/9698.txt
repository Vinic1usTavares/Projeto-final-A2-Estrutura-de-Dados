premiere episodes tend to be 30 rock s achilles heel but show comes roaring out of gate with do over a show that definitively breaks premiere jinx he said that frenetic farcical plotting of megan mullally s character in which she endured a disastrous trip to 30 rock studios bumped her head and lost her memory felt a little but laughs kept coming in conclusion rabin gave this episode an a grade rating television columnist alan sepinwall for star ledger felt that element s towards jack getting his old job back were fairly labored but noted that liz s adoption plot was more solid from start to finish he was complimentary towards kathy geiss character observing that her actions in episode were all frighteningly funny and enjoyed mullally s guest spot in conclusion sepinwall said that this was not best from 30 rock staff but they had some things they felt obligated to deal with and there was more than enough comedy genius that i can t really complain references external links category
