included in such legislation to encourage railway company to complete construction of its line as quickly as possible they also prevented unused permissions acting as an indefinite block to other proposals original date specified for completion of construction was end of 1896 but time required to raise finance and purchase station sites meant that construction had not begun by start of that year to give itself extra time clr had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by central london railway act 1894 construction works were let by etcl as three sub contracts shepherd s bush to marble arch marble arch to st martin s le grand and st martin s le grand to bank work began with demolition of buildings at chancery lane site in april 1896 and construction shafts were started at chancery lane shepherd s bush stanhope terrace and bloomsbury in august and september 1896 negotiations with ger for works under liverpool street station were unsuccessful and final section beyond bank was only constructed for a short distance as sidings to minimise risk of subsidence routing of tunnels followed roads on surface and avoided passing under buildings usually tunnels were bored side by side below surface but where a road was too narrow to allow this tunnels were aligned one above other so that a number of stations have platforms at different levels to assist with deceleration of trains arriving at stations and acceleration of trains leaving station tunnels were located at tops of slight inclines tunnelling was completed by end of 1898 and because a planned concrete lining to cast iron tunnel rings was not installed internal diameter of tunnels was generally for bank station clr negotiated permission with city corporation to construct its ticket hall beneath a steel framework under roadway and pavements at junction of threadneedle street and cornhill this involved diverting pipework and cables into ducts beneath subways linking ticket hall to street delays on this work were so costly that they nearly bankrupted company a further extension of time to 1900 was obtained through central london railway act 1899 apart from bank which was completely below ground all stations had buildings designed by harry bell measures they were single storey structures to allow for future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta each station had lifts manufactured by sprague electric company in new york lifts were provided in a variety of sizes and configurations to suit passenger flow at each station generally they operated in sets of two or

had carried 14 916 922 passengers by attracting passengers from bus services along its route and from slower steam hauled mr and dr services clr achieved passenger numbers around per year in first few years of operation generating a high turnover that was more than twice expenses from 1900 to 1905 company paid a dividend of 4 per cent to investors rolling stock greathead had originally planned for trains to be hauled by a pair of small electric locomotives one at each end of a train but board of trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own twenty eight locomotives were manufactured in america by general electric company of which syndicate member darius ogden mills was a director and assembled in wood lane depot a fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by ashbury railway carriage and iron company and brush electrical engineering company passengers boarded and left trains through folding lattice gates at each end of carriages these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform clr had originally intended to have two classes of travel but dropped plan before opening although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose soon after railway opened complaints about vibrations from passing trains began to be made by occupiers of buildings along route vibrations were caused by heavy largely unsprung locomotives which weighed 44 tons 44 7 tonnes board of trade set up a committee to investigate problem and clr experimented with two solutions for first solution three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension so weight was reduced to 31 tons 31 5 tonnes more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations for second solution two six carriage trains were formed that had two end carriages converted and provided with driver s cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive lighter locomotives did reduce vibrations felt at surface but multiple units removed it almost completely and clr chose to adopt that solution committee s report published in 1902 also found that clr s choice of 100 lb yard 49 60 kg m bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer bullhead rail on cross sleepers contributed to vibration following report clr purchased 64 driving motor carriages for use with existing stock together these were formed into six or seven carriage trains change to multiple unit operation was completed by june 1903 and all but two of locomotives were scrapped those two were retained for shunting use in depot extensions reversing loops 1901 thumb 291px left rejected route proposed in 1901 alt route diagram showing railway running from shepherd s bush at left to liverpool street at right with small loops extending beyond termini at each end clr s ability to manage its high passenger numbers was constrained by service interval that it could achieve between trains this was directly related to time taken to turn around trains at termini at end of a journey a locomotive had to be disconnected from leading end of train and run around to rear where it was reconnected before proceeding in opposite direction an exercise that took a minimum of 2 1 2 minutes seeking to shorten this interval clr published a bill in november 1900 for 1901 parliamentary session bill requested permission to construct loops at each end of line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting locomotive loop at western end was planned to run anti clockwise under three sides of shepherd s bush green for eastern loop alternatives were a loop under liverpool street station or a larger loop running under threadneedle street old broad street liverpool street bishopsgate and returning to threadneedle street estimated cost of loops was ps800 000 approximately ps today most of which was for eastern loop with its costly wayleaves clr bill was one of more than a dozen tube railway bills submitted to parliament for 1901 session to review bills on an equal basis parliament established a joint committee under lord windsor but by time committee had produced its report parliamentary session was almost over and promoters of bills were asked to resubmit them for following 1902 session among committee s recommendations were withdrawal of clr s city loop and that a quick tube route from hammersmith to city of london would benefit london s commuters mr and dr both offered services from hammersmith to city of london mr route ran via paddington and northern section of inner circle and dr route ran via earl s court and southern section of inner circle steam hauled trains were slow and suffered from having to compete for track space in timetables crowded with services from companies other routes prospect of quick electric tube trains offered an attractive alternative loop line 1902 05 thumb 291px rejected route proposed in 1902 alt route diagram showing railway as an elongated narrow loop with roughly parallel lines running from shepherd s bush at left to bank at right with a loop starting and ending at bank via liverpool street rather than resubmit its 1901 bill clr presented a much more ambitious alternative for 1902 parliamentary session reversing loops were dropped and clr instead proposed to turn whole railway into a single large loop by constructing a new southern route between two existing end points adopting committee s recommendation for a hammersmith to city route at western end new tunnels were to be extended from dead end reversing siding west of shepherd s bush station and from depot access tunnel route was to pass under shepherd s bush green and run under goldhawk road as far as hammersmith

northern piccadilly and brompton railway forerunner of today s piccadilly line from sloane street clr s proposed route ran below that approved for b pcr under eastern portion of knightsbridge under hyde park corner and along piccadilly to piccadilly circus at hyde park corner a clr station was to be sited close to b pcr s station and clr s next station at st james s street was a short distance to east of b pcr s planned dover street station at piccadilly circus clr planned an interchange with partially completed station of stalled baker street and waterloo railway clr route was then to turn south east beneath leicester square to a station at charing cross and then north east under strand to norfolk street to interchange with planned terminus of great northern strand railway route was then to continue east under fleet street to ludgate circus for an interchange with south eastern and chatham railway s secr s ludgate hill station then south under new bridge street and east into queen victoria street where a station was planned to connect to district railway s mansion house station route was then to continue under queen victoria street to reach clr s station at bank where separate platforms below existing ones were to be provided final section of route developed on proposed loop from year before with tunnels winding under city s narrow twisting streets tunnels were to run east one below other beneath cornhill and leadenhall street north under st mary axe and west to liverpool street station then south under blomfield street east under great winchester street south under austin friars and old broad street and west under threadneedle street where tunnels were to connect with existing sidings back into bank two stations were to be provided on loop at south end of st mary axe and at liverpool street station to accommodate additional rolling stock needed to operate longer line depot was to be extended northwards power station was also to be enlarged to increase electricity supply clr estimated that its plan would cost ps3 781 000 approximately ps today ps2 110 000 for construction 000 for land and 000 for electrical equipment and trains clr bill was one of many presented for 1902 parliamentary session including several for hammersmith to city route and it was examined by another joint committee under lord windsor proposal received support from mainline railway companies route interchanged with and from c slr which had a station at bank london county council and city corporation also supported plan metropolitan railway opposed seeing further competition to its services on inner circle questions were raised in parliament about safety of tunnelling so close to vaults of many city banks and risk that subsidence might cause vault doors to jam shut another concern was danger of undermining foundations of dutch church in austin friars windsor committee rejected section between shepherd s bush and bank preferring a competing route from j p morgan backed piccadilly city and north east london railway pc nelr without main part of its new route clr withdrew city loop leaving a few improvements to existing line to be approved in central london railway act 1902 on 1902 in late 1902 pc nelr plans collapsed after a falling out between scheme s promoters led to a crucial part of planned route coming under control of a rival underground electric railways company of london uerl which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration with pc nelr scheme out of way clr resubmitted its bill in 1903 although consideration was again held up by parliament s establishment of a royal commission on london traffic tasked to assess manner in which transport in london should be developed while commission deliberated any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed so clr withdrew bill clr briefly re presented bill for 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again before making an agreement with uerl in october 1905 that neither company would submit a bill for an east west route in 1906 plan was then dropped as new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for clr to reduce minimum interval between trains to two minutes without building loop wood lane 1906 08 thumb 255px left route approved in 1907 alt route diagram showing railway running from wood lane at left to bank at right wood lane is on

exhibition s white city site was across wood lane from clr s depot to exploit opportunity to carry visitors to exhibition clr announced a bill in november 1906 seeking to create a loop from shepherd s bush station and back on which a new wood lane station close to exhibition s entrance would be built new work was approved on 1907 in central london railway act 1907 new loop was formed by constructing a section of tunnel joining end of dead end reversing tunnel to west of shepherd s bush station and north side of depot from shepherd s bush trains ran anti clockwise around single track loop first through original depot access tunnel then passed north side of depot and through new station before entering new section of tunnel and returning to shepherd s bush changes were also made to depot layout to accommodate new station and new looped operations construction work on exhibition site had started in january 1907 and exhibition and new station opened on 1908 station was on surface

obtained parliamentary permission for a short extension northward from wood lane station on 1911 in central london railway act 1911 new e sbr line was constructed by gwr and opened as a steam hauled freight only line on 1917 electrification of track and start of clr services were postponed until after end of world war i not starting until 1920 when a single intermediate station at east acton was also opened wood lane station was modified and extended to accommodate northward extension tracks linking to e sbr existing platforms on loop were retained continuing to be used by trains that were turning back to central london and two new platforms for trains running to or from ealing were constructed at a lower level on new tracks which connected to each side of loop ealing broadway station was modified to provide additional platforms for clr use between existing but separate sets of platforms used by gwr and dr to provide services over extension clr ordered 24 additional driving motor carriages from brush company which when delivered in 1917 were first borrowed by baker street and waterloo railway for use in place of carriages ordered for its extension to watford junction new carriages were first for tube sized trains that were fully enclosed without gated platforms at rear and were provided with hinged doors in sides to speed up passenger loading times to operate with new stock clr converted 48 existing carriages providing a total of 72 carriages for twelve six car trains modifications made while in use on watford extension meant that new carriages were not compatible with rest of clr s fleet and they became known as ealing stock e sbr remained part of gwr until nationalisation at beginning of 1948 when with exception of ealing broadway station it was transferred to london transport executive ealing broadway remained part of british railways as successors to gwr richmond 1913 and 1920 in november 1912 clr announced plans for an extension from shepherd s bush on a new south westwards route tunnels were planned under goldhawk road stamford brook road and bath road to chiswick common where a turn to south would take tunnels under turnham green terrace for a short distance route then was to head west again to continue under chiswick high road before coming to surface east of london and south western railway s l swr s gunnersbury station here a connection would be made to allow clr s tube trains to run south west to richmond station over l swr tracks that dr shared and had electrified in 1905 stations were planned on goldhawk road at its junctions with grove road and road at emlyn road on stamford brook road at turnham green terrace for a connection with l swr s dr s turnham green station and at junction of chiswick high road and heathfield terrace beyond richmond clr saw further opportunities to continue over l swr tracks to commuter towns of twickenham sunbury and shepperton although this required tracks to be electrified clr received permission for new line to gunnersbury on 1913 in central london railway act 1913 but world war i prevented works from commencing and permission expired in november 1919 clr published a new bill to revive richmond extension but using a different route that required only a short section of new tunnel construction new proposal was to construct tunnels southwards from shepherd s bush station which would come to surface to connect to disused l swr tracks north of hammersmith grove road station that had closed in 1916 from hammersmith disused ls wr tracks continued westwards on same viaduct as dr s tracks through turnham green to gunnersbury and richmond plan required electrification of disused tracks but avoided need for costly tunnelling and would have shared existing stations on route with dr plan received assent on 1920 as part of central london and metropolitan district railway companies works act 1920 although clr made no attempt to carry out any of work disused l swr tracks between ravenscourt park and turnham green were eventually used for westward extension of piccadilly line from hammersmith in 1932 competition co operation and sale 1906 13 from 1906 clr began to experience a large fall in passenger numbers caused by increased competition from dr and mr which electrified inner circle in 1905 and from great northern piccadilly and brompton railway gnp br which opened its rival route to hammersmith in 1906 road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing horse drawn variety in greater numbers in an attempt to maintain income company increased flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in july 1907 and reduced fare for shorter journeys to one penny in march 1909 multiple booklets of tickets which had previously been sold at face value were offered at discounts and season tickets were introduced from july 1911 clr looked to economise through use of technological developments introduction in 1909 of dead man s handles to driver controls and trip cocks devices on signals and trains meant that assistant driver was no longer required as a safety measure signalling automation allowed closure of many of line s 16 signal boxes and a reduction in signalling staff from 1911 clr operated a parcel service making modifications to driving cars of four trains to provide a compartment in which parcels could be sorted these were collected at each station and distributed to their destinations by a team of tricycle riding delivery boys service made a small profit but ended in 1917 because of wartime labour shortages problem of declining revenues was not limited to clr all of london s tube lines and sub surface dr and mr were affected by competition to some degree reduced income from lower passenger numbers made it difficult for companies to pay back borrowed capital or to pay dividends to shareholders clr s dividend payments fell to 3 per cent from 1905 but those of uerl s lines were as low as 0 75 per cent from 1907 clr uerl c slr and great northern city railway companies began to introduce fare agreements from 1908 they began to present themselves through common branding as underground in november 1912 after secret take over talks uerl announced that it was purchasing clr swapping one of its own shares for each of clr s take over took effect on 1913 although clr company remained legally separate from uerl s other tube lines improvements and integration 1920 33 following takeover uerl took steps to integrate clr s operations with its own clr s power station was closed in march 1928 with power instead being supplied from uerl s lots road power station in chelsea busier stations were modernised bank and shepherd s bush stations received escalators in 1924 tottenham court road and oxford circus in 1925 and bond street in 1926 which also received a new entrance designed by charles holden chancery lane and marble arch stations were also rebuilt to receive escalators in early 1930s on 5 november 1923 new stations were opened on ealing extension at north acton and west acton they were built to serve residential and industrial developments around park royal and like east acton station buildings were basic structures with simple timber shelters on platforms poor location of british museum station and lack of an interchange with gnp br s station at holborn had been a considered a problem by clr almost since opening of gnp br in 1906 a pedestrian subway to link stations was considered in 1907 but not carried out a proposal to enlarge tunnels under high holborn to create new platforms at holborn station for clr and to abandon british museum station was included in a clr bill submitted to parliament in november 1913 this was given assent in 1914 but world war i prevented any works taking place and it was not until 1930 that uerl revived powers and began construction work new platforms along with a new ticket hall and escalators to both lines opened on 1933 british museum station having closed at end of traffic day before between march 1926 and september 1928 clr converted remaining gate stock carriages in phases end platforms were enclosed to provide additional passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side conversions increased capacity and allowed clr to remove from train crews with responsibility for controlling doors moving to two guards who each managed half train finally introduction of driver guard communications in 1928 allowed clr to dispense with second guard reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard addition of doors in sides of cars caused problems at wood lane where length of platform on inside of returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into depot problem was solved by introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal but which could be moved to allow access to depot move to public ownership 1923 33 despite closer co operation and improvements made to clr stations and to other parts of network underground railways continued to struggle financially uerl s ownership of highly profitable london general omnibus company lgoc since 1912 had enabled uerl group through pooling of revenues to use profits from bus company to subsidise less profitable railways however competition from numerous small bus companies during early 1920s eroded profitability of lgoc and had a negative impact on profitability of whole uerl group to protect uerl group s income its chairman lord ashfield lobbied government for regulation of transport services in london area starting in 1923 a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction with ashfield and labour london county councillor later mp and minister of transport herbert morrison at forefront of debates as to level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought ashfield aimed for regulation that would give uerl group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of lcc s tram system morrison preferred full public ownership after seven years of false starts a bill was announced at end of 1930 for formation of london passenger transport board lptb a public corporation that would take control of uerl mr and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as london passenger transport area board was a compromise public ownership but not full nationalisation and came into existence on 1933 on this date ownership of assets of clr and other underground companies transferred to lptb legacy for a history of line after 1933 see central line in 1935 lptb announced plans as part of its new works programme to extend clr at both ends by taking over and electrifying local routes owned by gwr in middlesex and buckinghamshire and by lner in east london and essex work in tunnels to lengthen platforms for longer trains and to correct misaligned tunnel sections that slowed running speeds was also carried out a new station was planned to replace cramped wood lane service from north acton through and ruislip to denham was due to open between january 1940 and march 1941 eastern extension from liverpool street to stratford leyton and newbury park and connection to lner lines to hainault epping and were intended to open in 1940 and 1941 world war ii caused works on both extensions to be halted and london underground services were extended in stages from 1946 to 1949 although final section from west ruislip to denham was cancelled following lptb takeover harry beck designed tube map began to show route s name as central london line instead of central london railway in anticipation of extensions taking its services far beyond boundaries of county of london london was omitted from name on 1937 thereafter it was simply central line clr s original tunnels form core of central line s route during world war ii of completed tube tunnels built for eastern extension between gants hill and redbridge were used as a factory by plessey to manufacture electronic parts for aircraft other completed tunnels were used as air raid shelters at liverpool street bethnal green and between stratford and leyton as were closed parts of british museum station at chancery lane new tunnels in diameter and long were constructed below running tunnels during 1941 and early 1942 these were fitted out as a deep level shelter for government use as a protected communications centre work on a similar shelter was planned at post office station renamed st paul s in 1937 but was cancelled lift shafts that were made redundant when station was given escalators in january 1939 were converted for use as a protected control centre for central electricity
