borders railway connects city of edinburgh with galashiels and tweedbank in scottish borders railway follows most of alignment of northern part of waverley route a former double track line in southern scotland and northern england that ran between edinburgh and carlisle that line was controversially closed in 1969 as part of beeching cuts leaving borders region without any access to national rail network following closure a campaign to revive waverley route emerged discussion on reopening northern part of line came to a head during early 2000s following deliberations in scottish parliament waverley railway scotland act 2006 received royal assent in june 2006 project was renamed borders railway in august 2008 and building works began in november 2012 passenger service on line began on 6 september 2015 whilst an official opening by queen elizabeth ii took place on 9 september railway was rebuilt as a non electrified largely single track line several surviving waverley route structures including viaducts and tunnels were rehabilitated and reused for reopened railway passenger services run half hourly on weekdays until 20 00 and hourly until 23 54 and on sundays timetable also allows charter train promoters to run special excursion services and for weeks following line opening scheduled steam trains were run background closure of waverley route in 1849 north british railway opened a line from edinburgh through midlothian as far as hawick in scottish borders a further extension in 1862 brought line to carlisle in england line known as waverley route after novels of same name by sir walter scott whose stories were set in surrounding countryside was controversially closed in january 1969 following recommendation for its closure in 1963 beeching report as an line according to information released by ministry of transport potential savings to british railways from line s closure were at least 000 in addition an estimated grant of ps700 000 would have been required to maintain a full service on line last passenger train over waverley route was edinburgh sleeper on 5 january 1969 worked by class 45 st anne s which arrived two hours late into carlisle due to anti closure protesters blocking line campaign to revive borders rail thumb left bowshank tunnel before borders railway project 2006 in 1992 borders architect simon longland conducted a motorbike survey of route which led him to set up company borders transport futures btf to evaluate possibility of reopening having carried out feasibility work in 1997 company came close to lodging parliamentary plans for what would effectively be a long siding for timber traffic from west coast main line at gretna to and where line would branch off along former border counties railway to kielder forest this scheme known as south borders railway was one of two projects promoted by btf other being north borders railway a commuter line from edinburgh to galashiels there were no plans to link two lines south borders railway ran into difficulties as a result of unwillingness of landowners to sell land based on btf s groundwork campaign for borders rail founded in 1999 was able to advance a project to reopen a section between galashiels and tweedbank to passengers first moves came in 1999 when scottish parliament supported a motion by christine grahame msp which called for reinstatement of line as a means of reversing economic decline of borders region this was followed by a ps400 000 feasibility study conducted by scott wilson and commissioned by scottish office which reported in february 2000 that there were no insurmountable planning or environmental constraints to reinstatement as much of original line could be reused although several major obstacles would need to be overcome which would entail substantial costs a number of blockages were identified in section between edinburgh and gorebridge first was breach of former line by edinburgh city bypass which intersected trackbed at a shallow angle resulting in more than of alignment being buried when bypass was designed local councils had requested that provision be made for railway but they were overruled by department of transport which insisted that trackbed should be cut on level two further breaches were reported as a result of improvements to a7 road between eskbank and gorebridge a small housing estate had been built on line in gorebridge even more encroachments were found on line south of tweedbank which would take infrastructure costs over ps100 million scott wilson report also indicated that patronage projections for a new line were not encouraging with none of route options examined producing a positive cost benefit value option which came closest to a neutral cost benefit assessment was a reopening only as far as gorebridge nevertheless scott wilson did indicate that reopening of line would benefit borders region by providing better links with edinburgh and creating up to 900 new jobs scott wilson also suggested that part of border counties railway as far as kielder forest could be reinstated at a cost of ps26 million to allow timber traffic to be carried on southern part of new borders line furthermore line speeds of 70 90 mph could be achieved on a single line resulting in a journey time from borders to edinburgh of 45 minutes compared to 55 minutes by car thumb right waverley route right of way near gorebridge prior to borders railway project 2007 despite recommendations in scott wilson report political pressure on scottish government to reconnect borders region eventually resulted in it giving support to extension of edinburgh commuter network by as far as galashiels area pressure came in particular from campaign for borders rail on behalf of which petra in february 2000 presented a petition with 17 261 signatures to public petitions committee of scottish parliament petition received unanimous support of parliament s rural affairs committee which submitted it to parliamentary chamber for debate at its debate on 1 june parliament passed unopposed motion sim 922 according to which it recognises and endorses case for establishment of a railway linking scottish borders to national network at edinburgh and carlisle and urges scottish executive to consult with strategic rail authority and others to facilitate its establishment scottish borders council midlothian council city of edinburgh council scottish enterprise borders borders transport futures railtrack and scotrail bid for ps1 9 million from scottish executive s public transport fund to allow a parliamentary order for reopening as far as tweedbank to be taken forward once funding had been obtained three local authorities created waverley railway joint committee to promote scheme consultant turner townsend was appointed to carry out necessary studies for a transport and works act application edinburgh crossrail while proposed borders railway was undergoing a lengthy period of consultation passenger services were reintroduced on surviving freight only section of waverley route between portobello junction and millerhill brunstane and newcraighall stations opened on 3 june 2002 latter being from edinburgh providing a park and ride service to city scheme cost ps10 million to build two basic stations and upgrade of track for frequent passenger services according to scotrail it was first proper heavy rail reopening with stations since privatisation and first permanent service to stations in east of edinburgh since portobello and closed in september 1964 plans for a station at portobello were abandoned amid concerns that trains using it would hold up services a half hourly service was launched using class 158s running alternately to and bathgate this service termed edinburgh crossrail extended from newcraighall through to edinburgh waverley and continued either onto north clyde line or fife circle line service from newcraighall through to north clyde line was later electrified as a byproduct of airdrie bathgate rail link leaving that from newcraighall to dalmeny and through to fife circle line with diesel trains crossrail was a success and provided forward momentum for borders railway project business case full business case for line was published in mid 2004 showing a modest benefit to cost ratio of 1 01 to 1 case was in some part built on projected housing developments 700 in borders and 1 100 in midlothian that led to an anti rail backlash in local elections with success of borders party representing party councillor nicholas watson described scheme as a colossal waste of money and called for funds to be used instead on glasgow airport rail link campaign for borders rail indicated that low ratio followed from choice to build a single track line for half hourly commuter services with no capacity for freight or specials a revised benefit cost ratio of 1 32 was announced in march 2008 despite costs of construction having risen to between ps235 million and million in february 2013 final business case was released by scottish government which showed a benefit cost ratio of just 0 5 1 this led journal local transport today to comment that line was one of worst performing major transport projects to be funded in recent times campaign for borders rail responded stating that ratio was based on modelling that underestimated route s potential patronage predicting only 23 431 yearly return trips from galashiels equivalent to only 70 passengers a day or three per train which would be less than number using existing bus service parliamentary approval thumb footbridge over former waverley route right of way in galashiels track has since been relaid under bridge in july 2005 waverley railway bill committee came out in support of reopening as far as galashiels bill was debated in september 2005 and a motion supporting it was passed with 102 in favour none against and one abstention on 9 may 2006 bill committee published its final report supporting project with two recommendations a station had to be provided at stow and line had to be completed to its full extent i e as far as tweedbank these recommendations were accepted by scottish parliament in final debate on bill on 14 june 2006 bill was carried by 114 votes to one waverley railway scotland act 2006 received royal assent on 24 june 2006 and sanctioned construction of around of new railway as far as tweedbank with seven new stations in total act had taken three full parliamentary years to be passed with 29 committee meetings 108 witnesses and a quantity of paper in height line is longest stretch of railway to be reopened in modern british history longer than robin hood line project as well as longest line in scotland since opening of west highland line in 1901 on 6 august 2008 waverley railway project was renamed borders railway project and put under control of transport scotland as statutory undertaker building works tendering process in october 2009 launch of a call for tenders stalled following discussions between scottish government and hm treasury over new regulations that required public private partnerships to be recorded as public expenditure a project timetable was announced by finance secretary john swinney on 4 november 2009 whereby he stated that construction of line would not begin prior to 2011 elections to scottish parliament tendering process finally began on 16 december 2009 when a contract notice was published in official journal of european union transport scotland announced in june 2010 that three that had submitted expressions of interest in project were to be invited to participate in a competitive dialogue these were bam uk sir robert mcalpine iridium de and carillion and new borders railway fluor miller and infrastructure investments in mid november 2010 withdrawal of fluor resulted in third consortium pulling out of bidding process second consortium withdrew in june 2011 following decision by carillion not to continue this led to cancellation of tender procedure by scottish transport minister keith brown network rail was chosen by transport scotland to undertake project and following months of negotiations a transfer of responsibility was signed at a ceremony held on 6 november 2012 at scottish mining museum in newtongrange network rail agreed to build line by mid 2015 for million an increase on estimated ps230 million that line was expected to cost and ps100 million that it was originally costed at in 2000 this figure is also substantially more than ps189 million which network rail chief executive iain coucher agreed to build line in late 2007 or early 2008 in december 2012 network rail appointed bam nuttall as its main contractor network rail team which worked on line was essentially same as one which delivered airdrie bathgate rail link in 2009 a network rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from previous project had been applied to borders project such as better coordination between different teams by having them together in one office in newtongrange in june 2013 design contract for line was awarded to urs which agreed to design new bridges stations and roads as well as refurbishment of existing bridges and provision of engineering support for ps3 5 million project specifications thumb left newly built viaduct over hardengreen roundabout october 2014 line comprises of single line track over a distance of plus 42 new bridges 95 refurbished bridges and two refurbished tunnels and required 1 5 million tonnes of earth to be moved stations are provided at and according to network rail line was not suitable for double track and in any event there was no business case for doubling line from outset as a result of line are single track with three dynamic passing loops providing of double track to allow for half hourly services route is not electrified but provision has been made to install overhead line if required as bridges have been built to gauge although certain sections of line are designed for speeds of up to average speeds over whole line are in region of amongst line s 27 substantial structures greatest engineering challenge was posed by point where track met edinburgh city bypass at that point a tunnel had to be constructed under a720 road while it had been temporarily diverted in total project incorporated five new associated road schemes major challenges were also posed by abandoned mine shafts to north of route some of which dated to 16th century and had not been mapped more than 200 bridges were involved in scheme as route crosses gala water and river tweed nineteen times one of most vital bridges on line carries track over hardengreen roundabout on a7 and required extensive works throughout 2013 other works included digging out an infilled cutting on outskirts of galashiels and reconstructing a nearby bridge to allow line to pass under power lines works commence first sod was turned at galashiels on 3 march 2010 when scottish transport minister stewart stevenson attended a ceremony in presence of campaigner madge elliot this triggered a clause in 2006 waverley railway act which committed scottish government to complete line to tweedbank once works had been commenced construction began in earnest on 18 april 2013 after completion of remedial and preparatory works such as land acquisition removal of vegetation demolition of certain structures and remedial works on old mines in midlothian for which over ps54 million was spent by network rail first task was excavation of track alignment through monktonhall and clearing of site for shawfair station construction of line s first bridge rye haugh bridge at were underway on 6 august 2013 as part of works to deviate line out of edinburgh from newcraighall before it returns to original alignment 23 arch newbattle viaduct or lothianbridge viaduct was used by lorries removing spoil from construction site which eased traffic on local roads thumb upright right preparations for track laying at bowshank tunnel november 2014 first track was laid in bowshank tunnel on 4 april 2014 on 30 september 2014 first train on waverley route for 45 years a works train ran to newcraighall tracklaying began in earnest on 6 october 2014 although preliminary works had resulted in a section of slab track laid through bowshank tunnel south of stow as well as ballasting along large sections of route and pre cast switch and crossing units for passing loops first part of route to be ballasted was section through lothianbridge viaduct to which structural repairs had to be carried out by end of october more than of track had been laid as far as tynehead and double track on shawfair loop had been completed plus of second track on borthwick loop work was halted in late november 2014 after a contractor working for bam nuttall in gala area was injured when a sleeper came loose when being lifted into position and landed on his leg work restarted on 12 january 2015 following a review by bam of their track installation methodology by 3 february track was complete through galashiels and hundreds of spectators turned out to welcome first train into station since 1969 which was hauled by class and completion thumb right queen elizabeth ii was carried to tweedbank aboard a train hauled by no union of south africa on 9 september 2015 shown here south of bowshank tunnel on 5 february 2015 network rail s tracklaying machine reached end of line at tweedbank station where a large crowd had gathered as there was not enough track for train to complete tracklaying into second platform it had to return next day formal completion took place on 12 february when keith brown clipped final length of rail into place during period of construction more than 1 000 rails were laid across 100 000 sleepers with infrastructure complete attention was turned to installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising stations a gsm r system controlled from next to edinburgh waverley was in place by april 2015 on 13 may 2015 first test train drs class 37 604 with worked tweedbank millerhill on 4 june 2015 a ceremony was held at edinburgh waverley to mark final stages of completion of works during which madge elliot a veteran campaigner and founder member of campaign for borders rail had class 66 528 renamed in her honour official completion and handover of line to scotrail alliance a group formed by network rail and abellio scotrail took place on 14 june 2015 a 12 week period of driver training for 64 drivers and 64 guards began on 7 june 2015 with abellio scotrail class 170 in livery promoting new line undertaking a proving run to measure stepping distances from platforms to

presence of its owner john cameron locomotive hauled a rake of mark 1s provided by as well as pullman car no 310 pegasus due to bad weather queen s helicopter journey from balmoral was delayed which resulted in late departure of train and a delay at newcraighall while a scotrail service cleared single line section to south her majesty alighted at newtongrange to unveil a plaque marking opening of railway a second plaque was unveiled at tweedbank following day lner class a4 commenced a six week programme of borders steam specials promoted by scotrail which saw services run to tweedbank for three days each week around 6 200 passengers were carried on 17 fully booked services during its first month of operations 125 971 passengers travelled on borders railway demand was far in excess of what scotrail had expected with line carrying 19 4 of its predicted annual patronage of 650 000 in one month unexpected level of patronage resulted in overcrowding on services and passengers unable to board at intermediate stations leading scotrail to run four or six carriages with morning and peak trains scotrail also leased additional parking space near tweedbank station as 235 space car park provided was generally full before 9am national mining museum near newtongrange station reported a hike in visitor numbers while nearby towns of melrose and st confirmed a rise in business and tourism route details line characteristics thumb left newbattle viaduct prior to refurbishment may 2000 line begins at newcraighall south junction where track veers off former waverley route to a parallel alignment just to west which crosses over former monktonhall colliery part of midlothian coalfield first of three double track dynamic loops begins here and continues for to king s gate junction just beyond edinburgh bypass new alignment some to south west of original route avoids new roads and mining subsidence on waverley route trackbed through millerhill whilst also serving new housing at shawfair there is a maximum speed limit on shawfair loop of with restrictions of at northern entrance to loop and at king s gate a new bridge carries edinburgh bypass across double track waverley route is rejoined at king s gate where it becomes single track for through eskbank newtongrange and gorebridge immediately after eskbank hardengreen viaduct an concrete span bridge carries line over a7 road at thereby correcting damage caused by dalkeith western bypass thereafter glenesk viaduct crosses river north esk a single arch span built for edinburgh and dalkeith railway between 1829 and 1831 which is one of scotland s oldest railway bridges this is soon followed by 23 arch newbattle viaduct between eskbank and newtongrange where single track runs down centre of structure as is case for viaduct on settle carlisle line second double track section begins at fushiebridge junction and continues for to just beyond site of tynehead station a single track section then extends as far as falahill where a reinforced concrete box takes line under a7 original alignment having been lost to allow road to be straightened across trackbed realignment at falahill as well as installation of single track on a wider double track alignment has allowed higher line speeds to be reached here than was possible on waverley route whereas curvature of old alignment limited line speed to new line has seen units reach speed limit for next to galabank junction is with a restriction at halfway point limit is raised to for south of tynehead although this speed is unlikely to be reached in practice due to gradient and short distance involved thumb right class 170 at tweedbank june 2015 final section of double track begins at galabank junction on approach to stow where a loop is entered by a turnout before proceeding through several reverse curves and bowshank tunnel to reach bowland points speed limit drops from to through bowland last stretch to galashiels and tweedbank is entirely single track save for approach to tweedbank tunnel is traversed just before galashiels and four river crossings are made in under which required new bridge spans at galashiels due to trackbed encroachment line deviates eastwards between a steep bank and side wall of a supermarket which occupies former station site for final to tweedbank line follows its original alignment over a reconstructed embankment and through an excavated cutting before crossing river tweed on category b listed redbridge viaduct in terms of gradients line proceeds on level until eskbank where it climbs to summit at falahill 880 feet above sea level at a ruling gradient of 1 in 70 and then descends at a typical gradient of 1 in 150 into galashiels and tweedbank falahill is tenth highest standard gauge railway summit in britain just lower than shap summit fushiebridge loop is on a 1 in 70 gradient and climbs southwards up borthwick bank which had posed a challenge in past for steam locomotives pulling heavy loads potential for further doubling exists around newtongrange where passive provision has been made line has seven sets of points two for each of three dynamic loops and one at tweedbank terminus places served thumb stow railway station old station building has been retained long route serves tweedbank galashiels stow gorebridge newtongrange eskbank shawfair newcraighall brunstane and edinburgh waverley stations with a total running time of 55 minutes for most services certain services are slowed due to conflicts with other operators services in edinburgh area none of new stations is staffed but ticket machines and train information have been provided all stations other than galashiels have park and ride facilities at galashiels local council built a ps5 2 million bus rail interchange station at stow was a late addition to scheme after lobbying by campaign for borders rail campaigning also resulted in extension of platforms at line s tweedbank terminus to to accommodate tourist charter trains of up to 10 12 carriages in length passive provision has been made for extension of all other station platforms from to eskbank station is convenient for an edinburgh college campus as well as midlothian community hospital naming of line first recorded use of term borders railway to describe reopened line was in a paper by corus rail consultancy in january 2004 entitled delivering an innovative borders railway which had been commissioned by waverley route trust previously edinburgh tweedbank line had been variously described as waverley railway and borders rail link in mid 2014 transport scotland considered launching a competition for public to submit their ideas for a name but scottish borders council was strongly opposed on basis that borders railway had developed a strong brand identity use of waverley line or waverley route for line was considered historically inaccurate by council and campaign for borders rail since these names were only ever used for whole of original line as far as carlisle patronage transport scotland business case for borders railway published in november 2012 central patronage forecast estimated that additional passenger return journeys made for first year of operation would be 647 136 this was broken down into edinburgh park 4 071 haymarket 35 329 edinburgh waverley 220 533 brunstane and

carried on line with weekly figures consistently showing over 20 000 journeys made figures released on 31 may 2016 showed that 694 373 persons had been carried since 6 september 2015 tweedbank station saw 183 918 passengers compared to a predicted 18 978 returns while galashiels had 104 593 against predicted 20 567 however eskbank gorebridge and shawfair recorded less than their predicted usage in september 2016 it was announced that one million passengers had been carried on reopened line final annual rail passenger usage figures for 2015 16 for each station were as follows edinburgh waverley

speaking in november 2012 scottish transport minister keith brown predicted that borders railway would bring inward investment into local communities as well as ps33 million of benefits for wider scottish economy construction phase itself would support 400 jobs and would act as a catalyst to increased business development and housing as area became within commuting distance of edinburgh car journeys would be reduced by 60 000 peak trips per year which would reduce carbon emissions and alleviate traffic and accidents on a7 and a68 roads housing prediction came to pass when as reported in edinburgh evening news on 5 august 2013 a housing boom had been triggered along line with number of new houses in midlothian having doubled in previous year many of which were located in proximity to line s stations it is expected that 4 000 houses will be built in shawfair area in next 25 years on 20 august 2014 alex salmond then first minister of scotland announced to a meeting with members of scottish borders council that he expected railway to benefit scottish economy by millions of pounds and that a feasibility study would be conducted to identify ways in which line could boost tourism in borders region research by moffat centre for travel and tourism business development has shown that visitor numbers for midlothian and borders tourist attractions increased by 4 and 6 9 respectively during first seven months of 2016 while abbotsford house sir walter scott s former home near melrose saw a significant revival in its fortunes as it reported a 12 rise in visits during 2016 a study released on 15 june 2017 and commissioned by transport scotland and borders railway blueprint group showed that 50 of line s users had moved to region and that more than 80 of those who had changed jobs cited railway as a factor in their decision study estimated that 40 000 car journeys had been saved per year as well as 22 000 fewer bus journeys report also indicated that 23 of visitors to area would not have done so without railway criticism thumb class 158 entering passing loop at galabank junction infrastructure capability line s construction has been described as resembling a basic railway built to a tight budget and incorporating a number of cost saving features such as using elderly two carriage diesel trains and running line as single track this is in contrast to reopened airdrie bathgate rail link which was built as a double track electrified railway from outset difference between two lines has been claimed by commentators to reflect scepticism toward borders railway which has existed since proposals were first made in 1990s as well as a reluctance to allow project to become too ambitious in particular a 2011 cost cutting exercise by transport scotland resulted in a new project specification which reduced dynamic passing loops from their planned length of and failed to future proof line by providing for all eight road bridges to be built to single track width only including five bridges on section between tynehead and stow where there were otherwise no other obstacles to doubling of line similarly key on section as far as gorebridge were also built to single track only notably bridges 16a and 24a over a7 at hardengreen and gore glen this was in contrast to quality of local roads built over new line including a720 which is wider than required to accommodate possible extra road lanes a press release by bam nuttall indicated that in addition to of new line borders railway project was funding of new roads it was later revealed that these late changes to rail infrastructure were insisted upon by network rail to ensure that project remained on budget and on time in addition lack of a siding anywhere on line could make it difficult for rescue locomotives to recover a broken down train without causing widespread disruption these fears were to prove justified as during line s first month of operation there were a number of well publicised problems ranging from overcrowding resulting in passengers standing for whole journey to timekeeping difficulties due to excessive dwell times at stations furthermore signalling problems led to disruption on line nearly a month after opening timetabling whilst campaign for borders rail acknowledged that half hourly weekday stopping service would be useful for commuters it questions whether this is best use of a line which could carry other types of traffic organisation had proposed a two tier service whereby both a half hourly stopping train and an hourly limited express service would continue north of gorebridge failure to continue to melrose scott wilson report did not consider extending line beyond tweedbank due to increased capital and operating costs of continuing further without a corresponding increase in passenger demand campaign for borders rail consider nevertheless that there would have been a strong case for reaching melrose on basis of town s role in borders tourism overcrowding since opening of borders railway there have been many complaints about lack of seats provision of ticket machines and lack of parking especially at tweedbank high demand has led scotrail to increase some services to three or four carriage trains however this and general opening of line have also contributed to there being a general shortage of
