experiments depicting a supernatural creature singer approaches every cage to look at all animals pigeons cats bobcats rabbits mouses a snake an owl a monkey a doe and heals them with her magic hands then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders during second refrain she remains standing with closed eyes in middle of room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of glass cages she thus releases animals and with a monkey in her arms leads them outside into woods standing in forest she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands last scene shows earth being covered by that light according to lionel mylene was very professional thorough discreet and almost shy when she participated in shooting of video he said she had to be careful not to get scratched by cat and that final scene was difficult to film because cats were afraid of water used in this scene rats remained hidden in a corner and birds did not fly much given
