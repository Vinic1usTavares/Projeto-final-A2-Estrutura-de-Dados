lyrical side of blacks howells wrote ultimately chesnutt is challenging idea of two races story serves as an allegory of changing relationship of freeborn and freedmen mixed race and blacks in a post reconstruction era such differences are expressed in language used by characters which also reflects differing education and class levels ryder speaks in high rhetoric of white english emulating tennyson he reads while liza uses a thick black dialect that difference is further emphasized by ryder s writing liza s address in flyleaf of his tennyson book and when recounting her story switching
