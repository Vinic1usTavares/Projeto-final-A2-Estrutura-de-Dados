emesa helmet also known as homs helmet is a roman cavalry helmet from early first century ad it consists of an iron head piece and face mask latter of which is covered in a sheet of silver and presents individualised portrait of a face likely its owner decorations some of which are gilded adorn head piece confiscated by syrian police soon after looters discovered it amidst a complex of tombs in modern day city of homs in 1936 eventually helmet was restored thoroughly at british museum and is now in collection of national museum of damascus it has been exhibited internationally although as of 2017 due to syrian civil war more valuable items owned by national museum are hidden in underground storage ornately designed yet highly functional helmet was probably intended for both parades and battle its delicate covering is too fragile to have been put to use during cavalry tournaments but thick iron core would have defended against blows and arrows narrow slits for eyes with three small holes underneath to allow downward sight sacrificed vision for protection roughly cut notches below each eye suggest a hastily made modification of necessity helmet was found in a tomb near a monument to a former ruler of emesa and considering lavishness of silver and gold design likely belonged to a member of elite as it is modelled after those helmets used in roman tournaments even if unlikely to have ever been worn in one it may have been given by a roman official to a syrian general or more likely manufactured in syria after roman style acanthus scroll ornamentation seen on neck guard recalls that used on syrian temples suggesting that helmet may have been made in luxury workshops of antioch description thumb alt black and white photograph of neck guard of emesa

helmet is made of iron and consists of two parts a head piece and a face mask head piece which includes a neck guard is made of one piece of iron and attached decorations attached to it are silver decorations some of which are gilded in whole or in part a diadem a circular forehead rosette a strip of metal serving as a crest two ear guards and a decorative plate over neck guard ear guards are each attached by three rivets top and bottom of which help hold diadem and decorative plate respectively to head piece edges of diadem and plate are folded over iron core for additional support face mask hangs from head piece by a central hinge and would be fastened with straps connecting a loop under each ear with corresponding holes in neck guard entire helmet iron core of which is between 1 and 6 millimetres thick weighs of which face mask comprises head piece is made of iron now rusted top contains a dent and shows rusted impression of what once was a woven and likely colourful or patterned fabric from ear to ear around forehead runs a gilded diadem in image of a laurel wreath a traditional symbol of victory each side contains thirteen elements each of three leaves and two berries leaves are worked in repousse and stand out in strong relief with nearly straight walls above centre of diadem is a rosette it shows a flower with two rows each of six petals and an outer beaded border beading and outer row of petals are in white silver contrasting with gilding of inner row background and central rivet anchoring rosette to head piece a narrow fluted strip serving as a crest smooth silver with beaded edges runs down middle of head piece from rosette to neck guard relative simplicity and inferiority of expressed by crest and rosette may reflect repairs made locally away from luxury workshops of antioch unlike with diadem for example background of rosette was not carefully punched down but was flattened with a tubular instrument and now presents as a series of rings thumb alt black and white photograph of a gold death mask resembling a human face gold funerary mask from tomb 1 neck guard flared outward to protect shoulders is covered with a decorative plate consisting of three horizontal designs at top over base of skull a large torus of ivy leaves is bordered by cords ivy is gilded though cords are not in middle a smooth and concave transitional zone corresponds to hollow of neck at bottom an acanthus rinceau or scroll is interspersed with birds and butterflies portions of bottom ornamentation are gilded giving helmet with all its silver gold and iron components a polychrome appearance ear guards encroach slightly on bottom design suggesting that it was not created specifically for helmet face mask is made of iron and covered with a sheet of silver central hinge from which it hangs is made of three parts an iron tube welded to interior head piece with an exterior silver tube a notched silver tube fixed to face mask that envelops first part and a pin which passes through both and has a silver knob at each end mask is shaped in form of a human face holes are drilled between lips and as nostrils eyes each have a narrow slit with three holes in a trefoil design two round holes outside and a heart shaped hole in middle underneath each eye to allow for a greater range of vision these apparently were not enough for a small and rudimentary notch was carved into each of heart shaped holes to increase wearer s vision mask is approximately 2 millimetres thick of which silver which is folded around both edges and each hole to hold it to iron accounts for between 25 and 5 millimetres distinctive features cover face mask nose is long and fleshy with a prominent bump and extends high between eyes cheekbones are low yet prominent and small mouth which droops toward sinister side shows a thick lower lip other features eyes and eyebrows and chin are more conventional distinctive features suggest that maker of emesa helmet attempted to translate some of individual characteristics of wearer s face into helmet function emesa helmet is highly functional and was likely made for both parades and battle it is thick and heavy which would have offered protection against heavy blows or arrows former of which may have caused dent on head piece exceptionally narrow eye slits also indicate care taken to increase protection rough manner in which holes underneath were enlarged is likely consequence of an emergency requiring a better field of vision although classified as a cavalry sports helmet type worn in equestrian displays and tournaments known as hippika gymnasia it was unlikely to have been used in such events tournament helmets were robust and manufactured without finesse to withstand rigours of contest unscathed delicate ornamentation of emesa helmet by contrast would have been damaged easily and thus suggests that it would have only been subjected to such risks in exceptional circumstance of battle discovery thumb alt black and white photograph of a circular gold disc with medusa s head and hair in centre one of six medusa ornaments from tomb 1 s sarcophagus helmet was discovered by looters in august 1936 in modern day city of homs known as emesa at start of first century ad city was at eastern edge of roman empire and ruled by emesene dynasty a client kingdom of romans nearly 2 000 years later looters digging near former site of a monument to sampsiceramus found a complex of rich tombs and removed grave goods their looting was uncovered because small golden plaques adorning burial shroud of body in tomb 11 flaked off when disturbed next morning children noticed these gold flakes mixed in with earth and brought them to a bazaar where it came to attention of police it ultimately led to arrest of looters and confiscation of grave objects objects including helmet were then secured for state collection by emir abd el kader curator of national museum of damascus even as merchants eager to capitalise on stories hawked modern forgeries and unrelated ancient objects said to come from tombs of emesa prompt intervention of el kader who investigated finds and interrogated looters allowed finds to be recovered and well understood he also led further excavations as did french archaeologists daniel schlumberger and henri seyrig tomb in which helmet was found labelled tomb number 1 of 22 in complex was a pitted grave with two chambers one upper and one lower lower chamber constituting proper tomb had soil for a floor and rock for walls it measured and was high between five and seven eroded basalt beams were placed over opening connecting lower chamber with upper which was then backfilled to surface level tomb 1 included a rich assortment of objects as well as helmet it contained a gold funerary mask a gold and turquoise bracelet an ornate gold ring with a royal bust in relief a gold ring with carnelian intaglio a gold applique with a sheep s head and a bird s head a star shaped fibula a gold hook a small tongue of gold a spearhead decorated with gold a silver vase and a triangle of glass looters may have been incorrect in also attributing 19 gold plaques to tomb as these were seemingly identical to those from tomb 11 decorations from sarcophagus included fragmentary silver rings 22 gold leaves in repousse six masks of medusa four rectangles adorned with a lion four victories and eight busts of apollo according to mohammed moghrabi who looted tomb 1 helmet was found next to skull restoration thumb alt cover of edition of 30 april 1955 of illustrated london news in black and white with a photograph of dexter side of emesa helmet taking up more than half page beneath which is a small photograph of front and a few paragraphs of text 30 april 1955 front cover of illustrated london news issued shortly after helmet s restoration after its discovery emesa helmet underwent several unsuccessful restorations primary problem was oxidisation of iron core which created blisters and cracks in silver covering immediately after discovery helmet was sent to paris for restoration by mm andre pere et fils only light work was carried out due to hope that syrian climate would help slow rate of oxidisation and due to limited funds but helmet continued to deteriorate by 1952 helmet was described as being significantly more damaged than it had been when excavated and in urgent need of further work eventually it was taken to british museum where a final restoration was finished in 1955 this was done by herbert maryon who in 1946 had reconstructed anglo saxon sutton hoo helmet in 1956 an account of process was published by harold plenderleith keeper of museum s research laboratory examination found silver to be brittle with cracks that had been filled in by a dark stopping substance iron behind face mask had rusted putting further stress on silver and forcing cracks open by as much as face mask held on by wire as hinge had detached was therefore removed from helmet to be worked on rusted iron was cut out from back of face mask around mouth and jaw where distortions were greatest to strengthen silver enough that it could be manipulated mask was placed in an electric furnace and temperature raised to over three hours blackened rust was then removed by brushing mask with 9 oxalic acid before heating it again at for eighteen hours and at for thirteen silver was then cleaned again on both sides with silver gauze temporarily soldered over cracks in back to allow front to be wiped down gauze was removed silver manipulated to close cracks and new gauze installed permanently using soft solder thin lines of solder showing through closed cracks were concealed with a surface coating of applied silver finally iron that had been removed to expose back of silver was cleaned and placed back in position although a few cracks remained visible higher up on face mask they were closed as iron behind them was sound and not exerting pressure yet would have to be removed for restoration to occur display thumb alt colour photograph of nijmegen helmet which like emesa helmet is silver and has a face mask shaped like a human face it hangs by a central hinge from a brow band which is decorated with five raised busts three of female figures and two of male figures nijmegen helmet is also classified as a cavalry sports helmet after restoration at british museum helmet was displayed in museum s king edward gallery as a month long loan from 25 april 1955 then returned to damascus from 1999 to 2002 helmet was part of a travelling exhibition syria land of civilizations with stops in switzerland canada and united states in 2017 national museum reopened after closing during syrian civil war but with more valuable objects still hidden in underground storage typology helmet is dated to first half of first century ad based on style of acanthus scroll on back of helmet and other objects found with helmet and in tombs nearby it is earliest known roman helmet with a face mask and is broadly classified as a cavalry sports helmet type d according to typology put forward by h russell robinson type d helmets are characterised by a single horizontal hinge attaching face mask to head piece and by head pieces that are decorated to represent helmets several type d examples exist such as nijmegen helmet but unlike these emesa helmet was probably never intended for sporting use it may instead have been given as a gift by a roman official to a general of ruling family of emesa or manufactured in syria to likeness of helmets seen during roman tournaments latter circumstance is thought more likely for acanthus ornamentation resembles that seen on syrian temples helmet may therefore have been commissioned from workshops of antioch known for their luxury notes references bibliography category 1936 archaeological discoveries category 1st century works category ancient
