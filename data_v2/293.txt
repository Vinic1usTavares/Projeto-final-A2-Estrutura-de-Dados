grey reef shark carcharhinus amblyrhynchos sometimes misspelled amblyrhynchus or amblyrhinchos is a species of requiem shark in family carcharhinidae one of most common reef sharks in indo pacific it is found as far east as easter island and as far west as south africa this species is most often seen in shallow water near drop offs of coral reefs grey reef shark has typical reef shark shape with a broad round snout and large eyes this species can be distinguished from similar species by plain or white tipped first dorsal fin dark tips on other fins broad black rear margin on tail fin and lack of a ridge between dorsal fins most individuals are less than long grey reef sharks are fast swimming agile predators that feed primarily on free swimming bony fishes and cephalopods their aggressive demeanor enables them to dominate many other shark species on reef despite their moderate size many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of reef to which they continually return however they are social rather than territorial during day these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop offs splitting up in evening as sharks begin to hunt adult females also form groups in very shallow water where higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young like other members of its family grey reef shark is viviparous meaning mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection litters of one to six pups are born every other year grey reef sharks were first shark species known to perform a threat display a stereotypical behavior warning that it is prepared to attack display involves a hunched posture with characteristically dropped pectoral fins and an exaggerated side to side swimming motion grey reef sharks often do so if they are followed or cornered by divers to indicate they perceive a threat this species has been responsible for a number of attacks on humans so should be treated with caution especially if they begin to display they are caught in many fisheries and are susceptible to local population depletion due to their low reproduction rate and limited dispersal as a result international union for conservation of nature has assessed this species as near threatened taxonomy and phylogeny dutch ichthyologist pieter bleeker first described grey reef shark in 1856 as carcharias amblyrhynchos in scientific journal natuurkundig tijdschrift voor nederlandsch indie later authors moved this species to genus carcharhinus type specimen was a long female from java sea other common names used for this shark around world include black vee whaler bronze whaler fowler s whaler shark graceful shark graceful whaler shark grey shark grey whaler shark longnose blacktail shark school shark and shortnose blacktail shark some of these names are also applied to other species in older literature scientific name of this species was often given as c blacktail reef shark c native to western indian ocean is now regarded as same species as grey reef shark by most authors it was originally distinguished from grey reef shark by a white tip on first dorsal fin a shorter snout and one fewer upper tooth row on each side based on morphological characters vertebral counts and tooth shapes garrick 1982 concluded grey reef shark is most closely related to silvertip shark c albimarginatus garrick j a f 1982 sharks of genus carcharhinus noaa technical report nmfs circ 445 this interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by lavery description thumb left upright 1 2 identifying features of grey reef shark include dark edges on all fins except for first dorsal fin grey reef shark has a streamlined moderately stout body with a long blunt snout and large round eyes upper and lower jaws each have 13 or 14 teeth usually 14 in upper and 13 in lower upper teeth are triangular with slanted cusps while bottom teeth have narrower erect cusps tooth serrations are larger in upper jaw than in lower first dorsal fin is medium sized and no ridge runs between second dorsal fin and it pectoral fins are narrow and falcate sickle shaped coloration is grey above sometimes with a bronze sheen and white below entire rear margin of caudal fin has a distinctive broad black band dusky to black tips are on pectoral pelvic second dorsal and anal fins individuals from western indian ocean have a narrow white margin at tip of first dorsal fin this trait is usually absent from pacific populations grey reef sharks that spend time in shallow water

less than however they have been known to dive to they are found over continental and insular shelves preferring leeward away from direction of current sides of coral reefs with clear water and rugged topography they are frequently found near drop offs at outer edges of reef particularly near reef channels with strong currents dianne j bray 2011 grey reef shark carcharhinus amblyrhynchos in fishes

blacktip reef shark c melanopterus and whitetip reef shark triaenodon obesus grey reef shark is one of three most common sharks inhabiting indo pacific reefs they actively expel most other shark species from favored habitats even species larger in size in areas where this species co exists with blacktip reef shark latter species occupies shallow flats while former stays in deeper water areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks c and vice versa this may be due to their similar diets causing competitive exclusion on infrequent occasions when they swim in oceanic waters grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes such as sailfish platypterus one account has around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins tursiops sp along with 25 silky sharks c and a single silvertip shark rainbow runners have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks using sharks rough skin to scrape off parasites grey reef sharks are prey for larger sharks such as silvertip shark at rangiroa atoll in french polynesia great hammerheads sphyrna mokarran feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are exhausted from pursuing mates known parasites of this species include nematode lata and several copepod species that attach to sharks skin and juvenile stages of isopods gnathia and g grandilaris that attach to gill filaments and septa dividers between each gill feeding thumb right lower teeth of grey reef shark are narrower than upper teeth grey reef sharks feed mainly on bony fishes with cephalopods such as squid and octopus being second most important food group and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters making up remainder larger sharks take a greater proportion of cephalopods these sharks hunt individually or in groups and have been known to pin schools of fish against outer walls of coral reefs for feeding hunting groups of up to 700 grey reef sharks have been observed at atoll in french polynesia iv iv on arte tv archive org they excel at capturing fish swimming in open and they complement hunting whitetip reef sharks which are more adept at capturing fish inside caves and crevices their sense of smell is extremely acute being capable of detecting one part tuna extract in 10 billion parts of sea water in presence of a large quantity of food grey reef sharks may be roused into a feeding frenzy in one documented frenzy caused by an underwater explosion that killed several snappers one of sharks involved was attacked and consumed by others life history during mating male grey reef shark bites at female s body or fins to hold onto her for copulation like other requiem sharks it is viviparous once developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk yolk sac develops into a placental connection that sustains them to term each female has a single functional ovary on right side and two functional uteri one to four pups six in hawaii are born every other year number of young increases with female size estimates of gestation period range from 9 to 14 months parturition is thought to take place from july to august in southern hemisphere and from march to july in northern hemisphere however females with full term embryos have also been reported in fall off enewetak newborns measure long sexual maturation occurs around seven years of age when males are long and females are long females on great barrier reef mature at 11 years of age later than at other locations and at a slightly larger size lifespan is at least 25 years robbins w d 2006

thumb upright 1 2 grey reef sharks become more active as night approaches alt photo of shark in waters with coral head in background grey reef sharks are active at all times of day with activity levels peaking at night at rangiroa groups of around 30 sharks spend day together in a small part of their collective home range dispersing at night into shallower water to forage for food their home range is about at enewetak in marshall islands grey reef sharks from different parts of reef exhibit different social and ranging behaviors sharks on outer ocean reefs tend to be nomadic swimming long distances along reef while those around lagoon reefs and underwater pinnacles stay within defined daytime and nighttime home ranges where strong tidal currents grey reef sharks move against water towards shore with ebbing tide and back out to sea with rising tide this may allow them to better detect scent of their prey or afford them cover of turbid water in which to hunt martin r a coral reefs grey reef shark reefquest centre for shark research retrieved on april 30 2009 little evidence of territoriality is seen in grey reef shark individuals tolerate others of their species entering and feeding within their home ranges off hawaii individuals may stay around same part of reef up to three years while at rangiroa they regularly shift their locations up to individual grey reef sharks at enewetak become highly aggressive at specific locations suggesting they may exhibit dominant behavior over other sharks in their home areas sociality thumb left grey reef sharks often group together during day such as this aggregation at kure atoll in hawaiian islands alt photo of dozens of sharks swimming in shallow water over pink coral social aggregation is well documented in grey reef sharks in northwestern hawaiian islands large numbers of pregnant females have been observed slowly swimming in circles in shallow water occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs these groups last from 11 00 to 15 00 corresponding to peak daylight hours similarly at sand island off johnston atoll females form aggregations in shallow water from march to june number of sharks per group differs from year to year each day sharks begin arriving at aggregation area at 09 00 reaching a peak in numbers during hottest part of day in afternoon and dispersing by 19 00 individual sharks return to aggregation site every one to six days these female sharks are speculated to be taking advantage of warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males off enewetak grey reef sharks exhibit different social behaviors on different parts of reef sharks tend to be solitary on shallower reefs and pinnacles near reef drop offs loose aggregations of five to 20 sharks form in morning and grow in number throughout day before dispersing at night in level areas sharks form polarized schools all swimming in same direction of around 30 individuals near sea bottom arranging themselves parallel to each other or slowly swimming in circles most individuals within polarized schools are females and formation of these schools has been theorized to relate to mating or threat display thumb upright 1 2 posture of a grey reef shark during normal swimming right and a threat display left bottom line shows shark s swimming pattern alt drawings showing threatening and nonthreatening postures from front and side underlain with a line that is jagged and red on left and gently curving and blue on right hunch threat display of grey reef shark is most pronounced and well known agonistic display a display directed towards competitors or threats of any shark investigations of this behavior have been focused on reaction of sharks to approaching divers some of which have culminated in attacks display consists of shark raising its snout dropping its pectoral fins arching its back and curving its body laterally while holding this posture shark swims with a stiff exaggerated side to side motion sometimes combined with rolls or figure 8 loops intensity of display increases if shark is more closely approached or if obstacles are blocking its escape routes such as landmarks or other sharks if diver persists shark may either retreat or launch a rapid open mouthed attack slashing with its upper teeth most observed displays by grey reef sharks have been in response to a diver or submersible approaching and following it from a few meters behind and above they also perform display towards moray eels and in one instance towards a much larger great hammerhead which subsequently withdrew however they have never been seen performing threat displays towards each other this suggests display is primarily a response to potential threats i e predators rather than competitors as grey reef sharks are not territorial they are thought to be defending a critical volume of personal space around themselves compared to sharks from french polynesia or micronesia grey reef sharks from indian ocean and western pacific are not as aggressive and less given to displaying human interactions grey reef sharks are often curious about divers when they first enter water and may approach quite closely though they lose interest on repeat dives they can become dangerous in presence of food and tend to be more aggressive if encountered in open water rather than on reef there have been several known attacks on possibly by mistake when shark struck at speared fish close to diver this species will also attack if pursued or cornered and divers should immediately retreat slowly and always facing shark if it begins to perform a threat display photographing display should not be attempted as flash from a camera is known to have incited at least one attack although of modest size they are capable of inflicting significant damage during one study of threat display a grey reef shark attacked researchers submersible multiple times leaving tooth marks in plastic windows and biting off one of propellers shark consistently launched its attacks from a distance of which it was able to cover in a third of a second as of 2008 international shark attack file listed seven unprovoked and six provoked attacks none of them fatal attributable to this species isaf statistics on attacking species of shark international shark attack file florida museum of natural history university of florida retrieved on may 1 2009 although still abundant at cocos island and other relatively pristine sites grey reef sharks are susceptible to localized depletion due to their slow reproductive rate specific habitat requirements and tendency to stay within a certain area iucn has assessed grey reef shark as near threatened this shark is taken by fisheries in many parts of its range and used for various products such as shark fin soup and fishmeal another threat is continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development there is evidence of substantial declines in some populations anderson et al 1998 reported in chagos archipelago grey reef shark numbers in 1996 had fallen to 14 of 1970s levels robbins et al 2006 found grey reef shark populations in great barrier reef fishing zones had declined by 97 compared to no entry zones boats are not allowed in addition no take zones boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited had same levels of depletion as fishing zones illustrating severe effect of poaching projections suggested shark population would fall to 0 1 of pre exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures one possible avenue for conservation is ecotourism as grey reef sharks are suitable for shark watching ventures and profitable diving sites now
