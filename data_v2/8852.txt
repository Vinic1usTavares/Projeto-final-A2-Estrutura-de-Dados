series there was pressure to recreate that success in film s follow up production this pressure came from mgm which along with its new owner billionaire kirk kerkorian wanted film s release to coincide with their public stock offering co producer michael g wilson also expressed concern regarding public s expectations subsequent to success of goldeneye commenting you realize that there s a huge audience and i guess you don t want to come out with a film that s going to somehow disappoint them this was first bond film to be made after death of albert r broccoli who had been involved with series production since its beginning rush to complete film drove budget to 110 million producers were unable to persuade martin campbell director of goldeneye to return his agent said that martin just didn t want to do two bond films in a row instead roger spottiswoode was chosen in september 1996 spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a bond film while timothy dalton was still in leading role writing as had been case with several previous films in series an entirely original story was required as there remained no ian fleming novels or stories to adapt scriptwriting process was finished very late due to lengthy disputes initial writers on project included john cork richard smith and novelist donald e westlake in 1995 westlake wrote two story treatments in collaboration with wilson both of which featured a villain who plans to destroy hong kong with explosives on eve of city s july 1997 transfer of sovereignty to china philip fall of city bond 18 and westlake mi6 confidential 32 2015 22 26 westlake used some of his ideas for a novel he completed next year though it wasn t published until 2017 under title forever and a death director roger spottiswoode said that in january 1997 mgm had a script that was also focused on hong kong handover however this plot could not be used for a film opening at end of year so they had to start almost from scratch at t minus zero bruce feirstein who had worked on goldeneye wrote initial script feirstein claimed that his inspiration was his own experience working with journalism stating that he aimed to write something that was grounded in a nightmare of reality feirstein s script was then passed to spottiswoode who gathered seven hollywood screenwriters in london to brainstorm eventually choosing nicholas meyer to perform rewrites script was also worked on by dan petrie jr and david campbell wilson before feirstein was brought in for a final polish although feirstein retained sole writing credit in film and in advertising meyer petrie and wilson were given credit with feirstein on title page of film s novelization by raymond benson while many reviewers compared elliot carver to rupert murdoch feirstein based character on robert maxwell there is a reference to mogul s death when m instructs moneypenny to issue a press release stating that carver died falling overboard on his yacht wilson stated we didn t have a script that was ready to shoot on first day of filming while pierce brosnan said we had a script that was not functioning in certain areas daily mail reported on arguments between spottiswoode and producers with former favouring petrie version but latter reinstating feirstein to rewrite it two weeks before filming was due to begin they also said that jonathan pryce and teri hatcher were unhappy with their new roles causing further re scripting title was inspired by beatles song tomorrow never knows eventual title came about by accident one of potential titles was tomorrow never lies referring to tomorrow newspaper in plot and this was faxed to mgm but through an error this became tomorrow never dies a title which mgm found so attractive that they insisted on using it title was first not to have any relation to fleming s life or work casting teri hatcher was three months pregnant when shooting started although her publicist stated pregnancy did not affect production schedule hatcher later regretted playing paris carver saying it s such an artificial kind of character to be playing that you don t get any special satisfaction from it actress sela ward had auditioned for role but lost out reportedly being told producers wanted her but ten years younger hatcher at 32 was seven years ward s junior and was in midst of playing lois lane on television show lois clark new adventures of superman for which she had been voted sexiest woman on television by readers of tv guide previous year according to brosnan monica bellucci also screen tested for role but as brosnan remarked fools said no daphne deckers who portrays pr lady also confirms that she saw same day she herself auditioned http www telegraaf nl vrouw daphne deckers ik at met james bond html bellucci would later go on to play a role in 24th bond film spectre role of elliot carver was initially offered to anthony hopkins who also had been offered a role in goldeneye but he declined in favor of mask of zorro natasha henstridge was rumoured as cast in lead bond girl role but eventually yeoh was confirmed in that role brosnan was impressed describing her as a wonderful actress who was serious and committed about her work she reportedly wanted to perform her own stunts but was prevented because director spottiswoode ruled it too dangerous and prohibited by insurance restrictions when gotz otto was called in for casting he was given twenty seconds to introduce himself his hair had recently been cropped short for a tv role saying i m big i m bad and i m german he

mildenhall some scenes were planned to be filmed on location in ho chi minh city vietnam and production had been granted a visa this was later rescinded two months after planning had begun forcing filming to move to bangkok thailand bond spokesman gordon arnell claimed vietnamese were unhappy with crew and equipment needed for pyrotechnics with a vietnamese official saying it was due to many complicated reasons two locations from previous bond films were used brosnan and hatcher s love scene was filmed at stoke park which had been featured in goldfinger and bay where they search for carver s stealth boat is phang nga bay thailand previously used for man with golden gun spottiswoode tried to innovate in action scenes since director felt that after tank chase in goldeneye he could not use a bigger vehicle a scene with bond and wai lin on a bmw motorcycle was created another innovation was remote controlled car which had no visible driver an effect achieved by adapting a bmw 750i to put steering wheel on back seat car chase sequence with 750i took three weeks to film with brent cross car park being used to simulate hamburg although final leap was filmed on location a stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated causing a member of public to call fire brigade upwards camera angle filming halo jump created illusion of having stuntman opening its parachute close to water during filming there were reports of disputes on set daily mail reported that spottiswoode and feirstein were no longer on speaking terms and that crew members had threatened to resign with one saying all happiness and teamwork which is hallmark of bond has disappeared completely this was denied by brosnan who claimed it was nothing more than good old creative with spottiswoode saying it has all been made up nothing important really went wrong spottiswoode did not return to direct next film he said producers asked him but he was too tired apparently brosnan and hatcher feuded briefly during filming due to her arriving late onto set one day matter was quickly resolved though and brosnan apologised to hatcher after realising she was pregnant and was late for that reason tomorrow never dies marked first appearance of walther p99 as bond s pistol it replaced walther ppk that character had carried in every eon bond film since dr no in 1962 with exception of moonraker in which bond was not seen with a pistol walther wanted to debut its new firearm in a bond film which had been one of its most visible endorsers previously p5 was introduced in octopussy bond would use p99 until daniel craig reverted to ppk as 007 in quantum of solace in 2008 music prolific composer john barry was in talks to return to james bond films for

chase sequence was co written with band who had worked with arnold on shaken and stirred soundtrack was well received by critics with christian clemmensen of filmtracks describing it as an excellent tribute to entire series of bond score at first theme song was to be written by arnold himself with help of lyricist don black and singer songwriter david who recorded demo however mgm wanted a more popular artist and invited various singers to write songs before one was picked through a competitive process there were around twelve submissions including songs from swan lee pulp saint etienne marc almond and sheryl crow crow s song was chosen for main titles arnold s composition surrender performed by k d lang was still used for end titles and features same prominent melodic motif as film s score this was fourth bond film to have different opening and closing songs moby created a remake of james bond theme to be used for movie two different versions of soundtrack album were released

very like connery s however in los angeles times kenneth turan thought a lot of tomorrow never dies had a stodgy been there feeling with little change from previous films and charles taylor wrote for

on film s twentieth anniversary observed of film s plot it s an improbable set up which was likely intended as a satire of murdoch s unaccountable media empire but risks of such technological manipulation have since proved to be frighteningly plausible den of geek also highlights that technology wasn t only modern danger to be pre empted by tomorrow never dies it also offers a revealing
