thirlwall recalled we hadn t written as a group before so we were very nervous and excited we sat with stannard and thought of ideas what kind of sound we wanted because at that point we didn t know anything really it was important to group for track to have a strong and positive message for their fans they wrote change your life with a female narrative in first verse and a male narrative in second verse so that song could relate to both genders little mix first shared cover art for change your life on facebook on 12 december 2012 an accompanying lyric video was released on vevo following

and chorus are spectacular and actually do muster feelings of inspiration in irish times ailbhe malone said its hook will remain in your head for longer than it ought to and although not as immediately impactful as group s previous singles wings and dna by third listen you ll be trying to copy jesy s soulful alto he wrote that lyrics vaguely recall unpretty by tlc david pollock of scotsman found track uplifting and argued that it balances band s sometimes formulaic pop sound with an emphatic and relevant message conversely fiona shepherd from same newspaper believed song reprises message of wings to lesser returns sam wolfson wrote in guardian that it starts off like it s going to be another patronising song about ignoring haters but its refrain has a far better
