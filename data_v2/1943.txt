market at place du jeu de balle in brussels where tintin buys model ship secret of unicorn was serialized amidst german occupation of belgium during world war ii herge had accepted a position working for belgium s largest francophone daily newspaper confiscated from its original owners german authorities permitted to reopen under directorship of belgian editor raymond de becker although it remained firmly under nazi control supporting german war effort and espousing anti semitism after joining on 15 october 1940 herge became editor of its new children s supplement with assistance by old friend paul jamin and cartoonist jacques van melkebeke before paper shortages forced tintin to be serialised daily in main pages of some belgians were upset that herge was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by occupying nazi administration although he was heavily enticed by size of s readership which reached 600 000 faced with reality of nazi oversight herge abandoned overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work instead adopting a policy of neutrality without need to satirise political types entertainment producer and author harry thompson observed that herge was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy public reacted positively secret of unicorn was first of adventures of tintin which herge had collaborated on with van melkebeke to a significant degree biographer benoit peeters suggested that van melkebeke should rightly be considered story s co scriptwriter it was herge s discussions with van melkebeke that led him to craft a more complex story than he had in prior adventures van melkebeke had been strongly influenced by adventure novels of writers like jules verne and paul d and this influence is apparent throughout story inclusion of three hidden scrolls has parallels with verne s 1867 story children of captain grant which van melkebeke had recommended to herge herge acknowledged van melkebeke s contribution by including a cameo of him within market scene at start of story this was particularly apt as van melkebeke had purchased his books in brussels old market as a child secret of unicorn was first half of a two part story arc that was concluded in following adventure red rackham s treasure this arc was first that herge had utilised since cigars of pharaoh and blue lotus 1934 36 however as tintin expert michael farr related whereas cigars of pharaoh and blue lotus had been largely self sufficient and self contained connection between secret of unicorn and red rackham s treasure is far closer thumb left 300px herge s illustration of sir francis haddock fighting red rackham s pirates in previous works herge had drawn upon a variety of pictorial sources such as newspaper clippings from which to draw scenes and characters for secret of unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources in drawing many of old vessels herge initially consulted then recently published l art et la mer art and sea by alexandre seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels herge consulted a friend of his gerard liger belair who owned a brussels shop specialising in model ships liger belair produced plans of a 17th century french fifty gun warship for herge to copy le brillant which had been constructed in le havre in 1690 by shipwright and then decorated by jean elder he also studied other vessels from period such as le soleil royal la la royale and le reale de france to better understand 17th century ship design it was from le reale de france that he gained a basis for his design of unicorn jolly boat no ship named unicorn was listed in annals of french navy but herge instead took name from a british frigate which had been active in mid 18th century fictional ship s unicorn figurehead was also adopted from frigate character of red rackham was partly inspired by jean a fictional pirate who appeared in a story alongside female pirates anne bonny and mary read that herge encountered in a november 1938 edition of red rackham s looks and costumes were also inspired by character who appears in c s forester s novel captain from connecticut and by 17th century french buccaneer daniel name of marlinspike hall in french was based upon name of real belgian town moulin actual design of building was based upon chateau de albeit with two outer wings removed in introducing francis haddock to story herge made captain haddock only character in series except jolyon wagg introduced later to have a family and an ancestry secret of unicorn was set entirely in belgium and was last adventure to be set there until castafiore emerald it would also be herge s favourite story until tintin in tibet historical parallels thumb right

early 18th centuries sir richard haddock 1629 1715 richard haddock was in charge of royal james flagship of earl of sandwich during battle of solebay of 1672 first naval battle of third anglo dutch war during fighting royal james was set alight and haddock escaped but had to be rescued from sea following which his bravery was recognised by british monarch king charles ii he subsequently took command of another ship royal charles before becoming a naval administrator in later life admiral haddock s grandfather also named richard commanded ship of line during reign of king charles i another individual known as captain haddock had lived in this period who had commanded a fire ship anne and christopher it was recorded by david ogg that this captain and his ship had been separated from their squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at malaga to purchase goods that could be taken back to britain and sold for a profit for this action haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674 where he was ordered to forfeit all profits from transaction and suspended from his command for six months secret de la began serialisation as a daily strip in newspaper le soir from 11 june 1942 as with previous adventures it then began serialisation in french catholic newspaper coeurs vaillants from 19 march 1944 in belgium it was then published in a 62 page book format by editions casterman in 1943 now fully coloured book included a new cover design created by herge after he had completed original serialisation of story along with six large colour drawings first printing sold 30 000 copies in francophone belgium secret of unicorn and red rackham s treasure were first two adventures of tintin to be published in standalone english language translations for british market as king ottokar s sceptre had previously been serialised in eagle in 1951 published by casterman in 1952 these two editions sold poorly and have since become rare collector s items both stories would be republished for british market seven years later this time by methuen with new translations provided by michael turner and leslie lonsdale cooper in english translation sir francis haddock is described as having served british monarch charles ii in contrast to original french version in which he serves french king louis xiv series danish publishers carlsen later located a model of an early 17th century danish ship called enhjorningen unicorn which they gave to herge constructed in 1605 enhjorningen had been wrecked in explorer jens munk s 1619 20 attempt to navigate northwest passage critical secret of unicorn resembled earlier adventures of tintin in its use of style colour and content leading harry thompson to remark that it unquestionably belongs to 1930s considering it to be last and best of herge s detective mysteries he asserted that this story and red rackham s treasure marked third and central stage of tintin s career also stating that here tintin has been converted from a reporter into an explorer to cope with new political climate he further added his opinion that it was most successful of all tintin s adventures jean marc lofficier and randy lofficier asserted that sir francis haddock was best realised character in story conversely describing bird brothers as relatively uninspired villains they went on to state that secret of unicorn red rackham s treasure arc represents a turning point for series as it shifts reader s attention from tintin to haddock who has become by far most interesting character they praised truly outstanding storytelling of secret of unicorn ultimately awarding it a rating of four out of five phillipe goddin commented on scene in story in which haddock relates life of his ancestor stating that reader is alternately projected into present and past with staggering mastery periods interlocked enriched one another were amplified and married in a stunning fluidity herge was at height of his powers thumb left alt photograph of a middle aged man speaking into a microphone herge biographer benoit peeters considered secret of unicorn to be one of herge s greatest narrative successes herge biographer benoit peeters asserted that both secret of unicorn and red rackham s treasure hold a crucial position in adventures of tintin as they establish tintin universe with its core set of characters focusing on former comic he described it as one of herge s greatest narrative successes through manner in which it interweaves three separate plots he felt that while religious elements had been present in previous stories they were even stronger in secret of unicorn and its sequel something which he attributed to van melkebeke s influence elsewhere he asserted that it explores this prelude with extraordinary narrative virtuosity biographer pierre assouline stated that story was clearly influenced in spirit if not in detail by robert louis stevenson s book treasure island in that it seemed to cater to a need for escapism he described adventure as a new development in herge s work a flight from topical to epics of pirate adventures set in distant horizons assouline also expressed view that ancestral figure of sir francis haddock reflected herge s attempt to incorporate one of his own family secrets that he had an aristocratic ancestor into story michael farr believed that most remarkable factor of book was its introduction of sir francis haddock highlighting that in his mannerisms and visual depiction he is scarcely distinguishable from captain haddock he also highlighted that scenes in which captain haddock relates tale of his ancestor carries on merging of dreams and reality that herge had experimented with in crab with golden claws and shooting star noting that unlike shooting star this two book story arc contains scarcely an allusion to occupation and war he praised arc s narrative as perfectly paced without that feeling of haste present in some of herge s earlier work in his psychoanalytical study of adventures of tintin academic jean marie apostolides characterised secret of unicorn red rackham s treasure arc as being about characters going on a treasure hunt that turns out to be at same time a search for their roots he stated that arc delves into haddock s ancestry and in doing so deals with meanings of symbolic relations within personal life discussing character of sir francis haddock he states that this ancestral figure resembles both tintin and haddock foundling and bastard thus making duo brothers as well as close friends he adds that when captain haddock reenacts his ancestor s fight with rackham he adopts his very soul his mana and is transformed in process apostolides also discusses red rackham noting that name red conjures up forbidden colour of blood and wine while rackham combines false brother with french word for scum then highlighting a potential link between rackham s name and that of capac an incan mummy who appears in seven crystal balls he further draws parallels between model ships containing secret parchments with arumbaya fetish containing a rare diamond which appears in broken ear literary critic tom mccarthy highlighted scene in which tintin was imprisoned in marlinspike crypt observing that it had parallels with tintin s exploration of tombs and other secret chambers throughout series he identified mystery left in francis haddock s parchments to be another appearance of tintin s adventures being framed by enigmas to this he adds that in solving enigma tintin shows that he is best reader in series and it is this which establishes him as oeuvre s hero mccarthy praised herge s silk as one of pivotal characters in series who can exude a presence far beyond that which we might expect from a novelist let alone a cartoonist pierre discussed scene in story in which tintin was imprisoned in crypt of marlinspike hall he stated that in this section herge offers us an embedded story a kind of interlude in which artist setting aside use value of objects takes liberty of giving them mischievous powers akin to a certain surrealism adaptations in 1957 animation company belvision studios produced herge s adventures of tintin a series of daily five minute colour adaptations based upon herge s original comics secret of unicorn was fourth to be adapted in second animated series it was directed by ray
