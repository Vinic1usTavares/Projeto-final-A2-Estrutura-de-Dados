president hutchison s claims and stating that lafayette college jumped to a conclusion too soon belding explained that texas law did not bar showell from field to play some papers went into great detail regarding technicalities that texas miners officials claimed lafayette college simply got wrong an article by corsicana daily sun on november 24 1948 stated that law in question only required negro players to have a separate lodging according to abilene reporter on evening of november 26 1948 el paso times believes officials of lafayette college injected negro question into sun bowl

to other schools of interest upon receiving lafayette college s original rejection of bid as seen in article by amarillo daily news on november 24 1948 rather than calling out lafayette s claim as a fallacy paper focused on fact that no further arrangements could be made with lafayette college once texas miners officials had already reached out to other schools impact on college football
