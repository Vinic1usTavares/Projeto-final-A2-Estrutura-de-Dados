milky way is galaxy that contains our solar system with name describing galaxy s appearance from earth a hazy band of light seen in night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by naked eye term milky way is a translation of latin from greek milky circle from earth milky way appears as a band because its disk shaped structure is viewed from within galileo galilei first resolved band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610 until early 1920s most astronomers thought that milky way contained all stars in universe following 1920 great debate between astronomers harlow shapley and heber curtis observations by edwin hubble showed that milky way is just one of many galaxies milky way is a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter between 150 000 and 200 000 light years ly it is estimated to contain 100 400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets solar system is located at a radius of about 27 000 light years from galactic center on inner edge of orion arm one of spiral shaped concentrations of gas and dust stars in innermost 10 000 light years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from bulge galactic center is an intense radio source known as sagittarius a assumed to be a supermassive black hole of 4 100 0 034 million solar masses stars and gases at a wide range of distances from galactic center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second constant rotation speed contradicts laws of keplerian dynamics and suggests that much about 90 of mass of milky way is invisible to telescopes neither emitting nor absorbing electromagnetic radiation this conjectural mass has been termed dark matter rotational period is about 240 million years at radius of sun milky way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference oldest stars in milky way are nearly as old as universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after dark ages of big bang milky way has several satellite galaxies and is part of local group of galaxies which form part of virgo supercluster which is itself a component of laniakea supercluster appearance thumb a view

antares thumb a time lapse video capturing milky way arching over alma milky way is visible from earth as a hazy band of white light some 30deg wide arching across night sky in night sky observing although all individual naked eye stars in entire sky are part of milky way term milky way is limited to this band of light light originates from accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in direction of galactic plane dark regions within band such as great rift and are areas where interstellar dust blocks light from distant stars area of sky that milky way obscures is called zone of avoidance milky way has a relatively low surface brightness its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or moonlight sky needs to be darker than about 20 2 magnitude per square arcsecond in order for milky way to be visible it should be visible if limiting magnitude is approximately 5 1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at 6 1 this makes milky way difficult to see from brightly lit urban or suburban areas but very prominent when viewed from rural areas when moon is below horizon maps of artificial night sky brightness show that more than one third of earth s population cannot see milky way from their homes due to light pollution as viewed from earth visible region of milky way s galactic plane occupies an area of sky that includes 30

inclined by about 60deg to ecliptic plane of earth s orbit relative to celestial equator it passes as far north as constellation of cassiopeia and as far south as constellation of crux indicating high inclination of earth s equatorial plane and plane of ecliptic relative to galactic plane north galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m declination 27 4deg near b berenices and south

approximately size of contiguous united states there is a ring like filament of stars rippling above and below relatively flat galactic plane wrapping around milky way at a diameter of which may be part of milky way itself thumb left 250px a schematic profile of milky way estimates of mass of milky way vary depending upon method and data used low end of estimate range is 5 8 solar masses somewhat less than that of andromeda galaxy measurements using very long baseline array in 2009 found velocities as large as for stars at outer edge of milky way because orbital velocity depends on total mass inside orbital radius this suggests that milky way is more massive roughly equaling mass of andromeda galaxy at 7 within of its center in 2010 a measurement of radial velocity of halo stars found that mass enclosed within 80 kiloparsecs is 7 according to a study published in 2014 mass of entire milky way is estimated to be 8 5 but this is only half mass of andromeda galaxy a recent mass estimate for milky way is 1 29 much of mass of milky way seems to be dark matter an unknown and invisible form of matter that interacts gravitationally with ordinary matter a dark matter halo is conjectured to spread out relatively uniformly to a distance beyond one hundred kiloparsecs kpc from galactic center mathematical models of milky way suggest that mass of dark matter is 1 1 5 recent studies indicate a range in mass as large as 4 5 and as small as 8 total mass of all stars in milky way is estimated to be between 4 6 and 6 43 in addition to stars there is also interstellar gas comprising 90 hydrogen and 10 helium by mass with two thirds of hydrogen found in atomic form and remaining one third as molecular hydrogen mass of milky way s interstellar gas is equal to between 10 and 15 of total mass of its stars interstellar dust accounts for an additional 1 of total mass of gas in march 2019 astronomers reported that mass of milky way galaxy is 1 5 trillion solar masses within a radius of about 129 000 light years over twice as much as was determined in earlier studies and suggesting that about 90 of mass of galaxy is dark matter contents milky way contains between 200 and 400 billion stars and at least 100 billion planets an exact figure would depend on counting number of very low mass stars which are difficult to detect especially at distances of more than from sun as a comparison neighboring andromeda galaxy contains an estimated one trillion 1012 stars perhaps milky way may contain ten billion white dwarfs a billion neutron stars and a hundred million

html filling space between stars is a disk of gas and dust called interstellar medium this disk has at least a comparable extent in radius to stars whereas thickness of gas layer ranges from hundreds of light years for colder gas to thousands of light years for warmer gas disk of stars in milky way does not have a sharp edge beyond which there are no stars rather concentration of stars decreases with distance from center of milky way for reasons that are not understood beyond a radius of roughly 40 000 ly 13 kpc from center number of stars per cubic parsec drops much faster with radius surrounding galactic disk is a spherical galactic halo of stars and globular clusters that extends farther outward but is limited in size by orbits of two milky way satellites large and small magellanic clouds whose closest approach to galactic center is about at this distance or beyond orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by magellanic clouds hence such objects would probably be ejected from vicinity of milky way integrated absolute visual magnitude of milky way is estimated to be around 20 9 both gravitational microlensing and planetary transit observations indicate that there may be at least as many planets bound to stars as there are stars in milky way and microlensing measurements indicate that there are more rogue planets not bound to host stars than there are stars milky way contains at least one planet per star resulting in 100 400 billion planets according to a january 2013 study of five planet star system kepler 32 with kepler space observatory a different january 2013 analysis of kepler data estimated that at least 17 billion earth sized exoplanets reside in milky way on november 4 2013 astronomers reported based on kepler space mission data that there could be as many as 40 billion earth sized planets orbiting in habitable zones of sun like stars and red dwarfs within milky way 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun like stars nearest exoplanet may be 4 2 light years away orbiting red dwarf proxima centauri according to a 2016 study such earth sized planets may be more numerous than gas giants besides exoplanets exocomets comets beyond solar system have also been detected and may be common in milky way structure thumb artist s impression of how milky way would look from different vantage points from edge on lines of sight peanut shell shaped structure not to be confused with galaxy s central bulge is evident viewed from above central narrow bar that is responsible for this structure appears clearly as would many spiral arms and their associated dust clouds milky way consists of a bar shaped core region surrounded by a warped disk of gas dust and stars mass distribution within milky way closely resembles type sbc in hubble classification which represents spiral galaxies with relatively loosely wound arms astronomers first began to suspect that milky way is a barred spiral galaxy rather than

signatures of inner spiral arms and bar their suspicions were confirmed by spitzer space telescope observations in 2005 that showed milky way s central bar to be larger than previously thought galactic quadrants a galactic quadrant or quadrant of milky way refers to one of four circular sectors in division of milky way in astronomical practice delineation of galactic quadrants is based upon galactic coordinate system which places sun as origin of mapping system quadrants are described using ordinals for example 1st galactic quadrant second galactic quadrant or third quadrant of milky way viewing from north galactic pole with 0 degrees deg as ray that runs starting from sun and through galactic center quadrants are as follows 1st galactic quadrant 0deg longitude l 90deg 2nd galactic quadrant 90deg l 180deg 3rd galactic quadrant 180deg l 270deg 4th galactic quadrant 270deg l 360deg 0deg galactic center sun is from galactic center this value is estimated using geometric based methods or by measuring selected astronomical objects that serve as standard candles with different techniques yielding various values within this approximate range in inner few kpc around 10 000 light years radius is a dense concentration of mostly old stars in a roughly spheroidal shape called bulge it has been proposed that milky way lacks a bulge formed due to a collision and merger between previous galaxies and that instead it only has a formed by its central bar however confusion in literature between peanut shell shaped structure created by instabilities in bar versus a possible bulge with an expected half light radius of 0 5 kpc bogdan c graham alister w bland hawthorn joss 2017 quantifying x peanut shaped structure of milky way new constraints on bar geometry abound galactic center is marked by an intense radio source named sagittarius a pronounced sagittarius a star motion of material around center indicates that sagittarius a harbors a massive compact object this concentration of mass is best explained as a supermassive black hole smbh with an estimated mass of 4 1 4 5 million times mass of sun rate of accretion of smbh is consistent with an inactive galactic nucleus being estimated at around per year observations indicate that there are located near center of most normal galaxies nature of milky way s bar is actively debated with estimates for its half length and orientation spanning from and 10 50 degrees relative to line of sight from earth to galactic center certain authors advocate that milky way features two distinct bars one nestled within other however rr lyrae variables do not trace a prominent galactic bar bar may be surrounded by a ring called 5 kpc ring that contains a large fraction of molecular hydrogen present in milky way as well as most of milky way s star formation activity viewed from andromeda galaxy it would be brightest feature of milky way x ray emission from core is aligned with massive stars surrounding central bar and galactic ridge thumb left illustration of two gigantic x ray gamma ray bubbles blue violet of milky way center in 2010 two gigantic spherical bubbles of high energy emission were detected to north and south of milky way core using data from fermi gamma ray space telescope diameter of each of bubbles is about they stretch up to grus and to virgo on night sky of southern hemisphere subsequently observations with parkes telescope at radio frequencies identified polarized emission that is associated with fermi bubbles these observations are best interpreted as a magnetized outflow driven by star formation in central of milky way later on january 5 2015 nasa reported observing an x ray flare 400 times brighter than usual a record breaker from sagittarius a unusual event may have been caused by breaking apart of an asteroid falling into black hole or by entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into sagittarius a spiral arms outside gravitational influence of galactic bar structure of interstellar medium and stars in disk of milky way is organized into four spiral arms spiral arms typically contain a higher density of interstellar gas and dust than galactic average as well as a greater concentration of star formation as traced by h ii regions and molecular clouds milky way s spiral structure is uncertain and there is currently no consensus on nature of milky way s spiral arms perfect logarithmic spiral patterns only crudely describe features near sun because galaxies commonly have arms that branch merge twist unexpectedly and feature a degree of irregularity possible scenario of sun within a spur local arm emphasizes that point and indicates that such features are probably not unique and exist elsewhere in milky way estimates of pitch angle of arms range from about 7deg to 25deg there are thought to be four spiral arms that all start near milky way s center these are named as follows with positions of arms shown in image at right thumb 500px observed normal lines and extrapolated dotted lines structure of spiral arms of milky way viewed from north of galaxy stars generally move clockwise in this view gray lines radiating from sun s position upper center list three letter abbreviations of corresponding constellations s 3 kpc arm and perseus and outer arm along with extension discovered in 2004 centaurus sagittarius are at least two smaller arms or spurs including cygnus arm which contains sun and solar system two spiral arms scutum centaurus arm and carina sagittarius arm have tangent points inside sun s orbit about center of milky way if these arms contain an overdensity of stars compared to average density of stars in galactic disk it would be detectable by counting stars near tangent point two surveys of near infrared light which is sensitive primarily to red giants and not affected by dust extinction detected predicted overabundance in scutum centaurus arm but not in carina sagittarius arm scutum centaurus arm contains approximately 30 more red giants than would be expected in absence of a spiral arm this observation suggests that milky way possesses only two major stellar arms perseus arm and scutum centaurus arm rest of arms contain excess gas but not excess old stars in december 2013 astronomers found that distribution of young stars and star forming regions matches four arm spiral description of milky way massive stars mark out milky way s missing arms university of leeds december 17 2013 retrieved december 18 2013 thus milky way appears to have two spiral arms as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as traced by gas and young stars explanation for this apparent discrepancy is unclear thumb left 200px clusters detected by wise used to

be expanding away from central bulge at more than 50 km s it is located in fourth galactic quadrant at a distance of about 5 2 kpc from sun and 3 3 kpc from galactic center far 3 kpc arm was discovered in 2008 by astronomer tom dame harvard smithsonian cfa it is located in first galactic quadrant at a distance of 3 kpc about 10 000 ly from galactic center a simulation published in 2011 suggested that milky way may have obtained its spiral arm structure as a result of repeated collisions with sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy it has been suggested that milky way contains two different spiral patterns an inner one formed by sagittarius arm that rotates fast and an outer one formed by carina and perseus arms whose rotation velocity is slower and whose arms are tightly wound in this scenario suggested by numerical simulations of dynamics of different spiral arms outer pattern would form an outer and two patterns would be connected by cygnus arm thumb upright 1 25 long molecular cloud dubbed nessie probably forms a dense spine of scutum centarus arm outside of major spiral arms is monoceros ring or outer ring a ring of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago however several members of scientific community recently restated their position affirming monoceros structure is nothing more than an over density produced by flared and warped thick disk of milky way structure of milky way s disk is warped along an s curve halo galactic disk is surrounded by a spheroidal halo of old stars and globular clusters of which 90 lie within of galactic center however a few globular clusters have been found farther such as pal 4 and am1 at more than 200 000 light years from galactic center about 40 of milky way s clusters are on retrograde orbits which means they move in opposite direction from milky way rotation globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about milky way in contrast to elliptical orbit of a planet around a star although disk contains dust that obscures view in some wavelengths halo component does not active star formation takes place in disk especially in spiral arms which represent areas of high density but does not take place in halo as there is little cool gas to collapse into stars open clusters are also located primarily in disk discoveries in early 21st century have added dimension to knowledge of milky way s structure with discovery that disk of andromeda galaxy m31 extends much farther than previously thought possibility of disk of milky way extending farther is apparent and this is supported by evidence from discovery of outer arm extension of cygnus arm and of a similar extension of scutum centaurus arm with discovery of sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy came discovery of a ribbon of galactic debris as polar orbit of dwarf and its interaction with milky way tears it apart similarly with discovery of canis major dwarf galaxy it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with milky way encircles galactic disk sloan digital sky survey of northern sky shows a huge and diffuse structure spread out across an area around 5 000 times size of a full moon within milky way that does not seem to fit within current models collection of stars rises close to perpendicular to plane of spiral arms of milky way proposed likely interpretation is that a dwarf galaxy is merging with milky way this galaxy is tentatively named virgo stellar stream and is found in direction of virgo about away gaseous halo in addition to stellar halo chandra x ray observatory xmm newton and suzaku have provided evidence that there is a gaseous halo with a large amount of hot gas halo extends for hundreds of thousand of light years much farther than stellar halo and close to distance of large and small magellanic clouds mass of this hot halo is nearly equivalent to mass of milky way itself temperature of this halo gas is between 1 and 2 5 million k 1 8 and 4 5 million degf observations of distant galaxies indicate that universe had about one sixth as much baryonic ordinary matter as dark matter when it was just a few billion years old however only about half of those baryons are accounted for in modern universe based on observations of nearby galaxies like milky way if finding that mass of halo is comparable to mass of milky way is confirmed it could be identity of missing baryons around milky way sun s location and neighborhood sun is near inner rim of orion arm within local fluff of local bubble and in gould belt based upon studies of stellar orbits around sgr a by and associates 2016 sun lies at an estimated distance of from galactic center and associates 2016 found a smaller value of also using a star orbit analysis sun is currently above or north of central plane of galactic disk distance between local arm and next arm out perseus arm is about sun and thus solar system is located in milky way s galactic habitable zone there are about 208 stars brighter than absolute magnitude 8 5 within a sphere with a radius of from sun giving a density of one star per 69 cubic parsecs or one star per 2 360 cubic light years from list of nearest bright stars on other hand there are 64 known stars of any magnitude not counting 4 brown dwarfs within of sun giving a density of about one star per 8 2 cubic parsecs or one per 284 cubic light years from list of nearest stars this illustrates fact that there are far more faint stars than bright stars in entire sky there are about 500 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 4 but 15 5 million stars brighter than apparent magnitude 14 apex of sun s way or solar apex is direction that sun travels through space in milky way general direction of sun s galactic motion is towards star vega near constellation of hercules at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to direction of galactic center sun s orbit about milky way is expected to be roughly elliptical with addition of perturbations due to galactic spiral arms and non uniform mass distributions in addition sun passes through galactic plane approximately 2 7 times per orbit this is very similar to how a simple harmonic oscillator works with no drag force damping term these oscillations were until recently thought to coincide with mass lifeform extinction periods on earth however a reanalysis of effects of sun s transit through spiral structure based on co data has failed to find a correlation it takes solar system about 240 million years to complete one orbit of milky way a galactic year so sun is thought to have completed 18 20 orbits during its lifetime and 1 1250 of a revolution since origin of humans orbital speed of solar system about center of milky way is approximately or 0 073 of speed of light sun moves through heliosphere at at this speed it takes around 1 400 years for solar system to travel a distance of 1 light year or 8 days to travel 1 au astronomical unit solar system is headed in direction of zodiacal constellation scorpius which follows ecliptic galactic rotation thumb right galaxy rotation curve for milky way vertical axis is speed of rotation about galactic center horizontal axis is distance from galactic center in kpcs sun is marked with a yellow ball observed curve of speed of rotation is blue predicted curve based upon stellar mass and gas in milky way is red scatter in observations roughly indicated by gray bars difference is due to dark matter stars and gas in milky way rotate about its center differentially meaning that rotation period varies with location as is typical for spiral galaxies orbital speed of most stars in milky way does not depend strongly on their distance from center away from central bulge or outer rim typical stellar orbital speed is between median statistics estimate of galactic rotational velocity hence orbital period of typical star is directly proportional only to length of path traveled this is unlike situation within solar system where two body gravitational dynamics dominate and different orbits have significantly different velocities associated with them rotation curve shown in figure describes this rotation toward center of milky way orbit speeds are too low whereas beyond 7 kpcs speeds are too high to match what would be expected from universal law of gravitation if milky way contained only mass observed in stars gas and other baryonic ordinary matter rotation speed would decrease with distance from center however observed curve is relatively flat indicating that there is additional mass that cannot be detected directly with electromagnetic radiation this inconsistency is attributed to dark matter rotation curve of milky way agrees with universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies best evidence for existence of dark matter in galaxies alternatively a minority of astronomers propose that a modification of law of gravity may explain observed rotation curve formation milky way began as one or several small overdensities in mass distribution in universe shortly after big bang some of these overdensities were seeds of globular clusters in which oldest remaining stars in what is now milky way formed nearly half matter in milky way may have come from other distant galaxies nonetheless these stars and clusters now comprise stellar halo of milky way within a few billion years of birth of first stars mass of milky way was large enough so that it was spinning relatively quickly due to conservation of angular momentum this led gaseous interstellar medium to collapse from a roughly spheroidal shape to a disk therefore later generations of stars formed in this spiral disk most younger stars including sun are observed to be in disk since first stars began to form milky way has grown through both galaxy mergers particularly early in milky way s growth and accretion of gas directly from galactic halo milky way is currently accreting material from several small galaxies including two of its largest satellite galaxies large and small magellanic clouds through magellanic stream direct accretion of gas is observed in high velocity clouds like smith cloud however properties of milky way such as stellar mass angular momentum and metallicity in its outermost regions suggest it has undergone no mergers with large galaxies in last 10 billion years this lack of recent major mergers is unusual among similar spiral galaxies its neighbour andromeda galaxy appears to have a more typical history shaped by more recent mergers with relatively large galaxies according to recent studies milky way as well as andromeda galaxy lie in what in galaxy color magnitude diagram is known as green valley a region populated by galaxies in transition from blue cloud galaxies actively forming new stars to red sequence galaxies that lack star formation star formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star forming gas in interstellar medium in simulated galaxies with similar properties star formation will typically have been extinguished within about five billion years from now even accounting for expected short term increase in rate of star formation due to collision between both milky way and andromeda galaxy in fact measurements of other galaxies similar to milky way suggest it is among reddest and brightest spiral galaxies that are still forming new stars and it is just slightly bluer than bluest red sequence galaxies in 2019 scientists at research institute of observational sciences aries discovered 28 new stars in milky way age and cosmological history thumb left illustration of a night sky from a hypothetical planet within milky way 10 billion years ago globular clusters are among oldest objects in milky way which thus set a lower limit on age of milky way ages of individual stars in milky way can be estimated by measuring abundance of long lived radioactive elements such as thorium 232 and uranium 238 then comparing results to estimates of their original abundance a technique called nucleocosmochronology these yield values of about for cs 001 and for bd 17deg once a white dwarf is formed it begins to undergo radiative cooling and surface temperature steadily drops by measuring temperatures of coolest of these white dwarfs and comparing them to their expected initial temperature an age estimate can be made with this technique age of globular cluster m4 was estimated as age estimates of oldest of these clusters gives a best fit estimate of 12 6 billion years and a 95 confidence upper limit of 16 billion years in november 2018 astronomers reported discovery of one of oldest stars in universe about 13 5 billion years old 2mass b is a tiny ultra metal poor ump star made almost entirely of materials released from big bang and is possibly one of very first stars discovery of star in milky way galaxy suggests that galaxy may be at least 3 billion years older than previously thought several individual stars have been found in milky way s halo with measured ages very close to 13 80 billion year age of universe in 2007 a star in galactic halo he 1523 was estimated to be about 13 2 billion years old as oldest known object in milky way at that time this measurement placed a lower limit on age of milky way this estimate was made using uv visual echelle spectrograph of very large telescope to measure relative strengths of spectral lines caused by presence of thorium and other elements created by r process line strengths yield abundances of different elemental isotopes from which an estimate of age of star can be derived using nucleocosmochronology another star hd is 14 5 0 7 billion years old according to observations utilizing adaptive optics to correct for earth s atmospheric distortion stars in galaxy s bulge date to about 12 8 billion years old age of stars in galactic thin disk has also been estimated using nucleocosmochronology measurements of thin disk stars yield an estimate that thin disk formed 8 8 1 7 billion years ago these measurements suggest there was a hiatus of almost 5 billion years between formation of galactic halo and thin disk recent analysis of chemical signatures of thousands of stars suggests that stellar formation might have dropped by an order of magnitude at time of disk formation 10 to 8 billion years ago when interstellar gas was too hot to form new stars at same rate as before ramon 2016 milky way retired early from star making new scientist march 5 2016 p 9 satellite galaxies surrounding milky way are not randomly distributed but seemed to be result of a break up of some larger system producing a ring structure 500 000 light years in diameter and 50 000 light years wide close encounters between galaxies like that expected in 4 billion years with andromeda galaxy rips off huge tails of gas which over time can coalesce to form dwarf galaxies in a ring at an arbitrary angle to main disc environment milky way and andromeda galaxy are a binary system of giant spiral galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as local group surrounded by a local void itself being part of virgo supercluster surrounding virgo supercluster are a number of voids devoid of many galaxies microscopium void to north sculptor void to left bootes void to right and canes major void to south these voids change shape over time creating filamentous structures of galaxies virgo supercluster for instance is being drawn towards great attractor adam 2016 nothing really matters gaping cosmic voids discover dec 2016 which in turn forms part of a greater structure called laniakea two smaller galaxies and a number of dwarf galaxies in local group orbit milky way largest of these is large magellanic cloud with a diameter of 14 000 light years it has a close companion small magellanic cloud magellanic stream is a stream of neutral hydrogen gas extending from these two small galaxies across 100deg of sky stream is thought to have been dragged from magellanic clouds in tidal interactions with milky way some of dwarf galaxies orbiting milky way are canis major dwarf closest sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy ursa minor dwarf sculptor dwarf dwarf fornax dwarf and leo i dwarf smallest dwarf galaxies of milky way are only 500 light years in diameter these include carina dwarf draco dwarf and leo ii dwarf there may still be undetected dwarf galaxies that are dynamically bound to milky way which is supported by detection of nine new satellites of milky way in a relatively small patch of night sky in 2015 there are also some dwarf galaxies that have already been absorbed by milky way such as progenitor of omega centauri in 2014 researchers reported that most satellite galaxies of milky way lie in a very large disk and orbit in same direction this came as a surprise according to standard cosmology satellite galaxies should form in dark matter halos and they should be widely distributed and moving in random directions this discrepancy is still not fully explained in january 2006 researchers reported that heretofore unexplained warp in disk of milky way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by large and small magellanic clouds as they orbit milky way causing vibrations when they pass through its edges previously these two galaxies at around 2 of mass of milky way were considered too small to influence milky way however in a computer model movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter wake that amplifies their influence on larger milky way current measurements suggest andromeda galaxy is approaching us at in 3 to 4 billion years there may be an andromeda milky way collision depending on importance of unknown lateral components to galaxies relative motion if they collide chance of individual stars colliding with each other is extremely low but instead two galaxies will merge to form a single elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disk galaxy over course of about a billion years velocity although special relativity states that there is no preferred inertial frame of reference in space with which to compare milky way milky way does have a velocity with respect to cosmological frames of reference one such frame of reference is hubble flow apparent motions of galaxy clusters due to expansion of space individual galaxies including milky way have peculiar velocities relative to average flow thus to compare milky way to hubble flow one must consider a volume large enough so that expansion of universe dominates over local random motions a large enough volume means that mean motion of galaxies within this volume is equal to hubble flow astronomers believe milky way is moving at approximately with respect to this local co moving frame of reference milky way is moving in general direction of great attractor and other galaxy clusters including shapley supercluster behind it local group a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing among others milky way and andromeda galaxy is part of a supercluster called local supercluster centered near virgo cluster although they are moving away from each other at as part of hubble flow this velocity is less than would be expected given 16 8 million pc distance due to gravitational attraction between local group and virgo cluster another reference frame is provided by cosmic microwave background cmb milky way is moving at with respect to photons of cmb toward 10 5 right ascension 24deg declination j2000 epoch near center of hydra this motion is observed by satellites such as cosmic background explorer and wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe wmap as a dipole contribution to cmb as photons in equilibrium in cmb

forming adjectives is also root of galaxy name for our and later all such collections of stars in greek mythology milky way was formed after trickster god hermes suckled infant heracles at breast of hera queen of gods while she was asleep when hera awoke she tore heracles away from her breast and splattered her breast milk across heavens in another version of story athena patron goddess of heroes tricked hera into suckling heracles voluntarily but he bit her nipple so hard that she flung him away spraying milk everywhere milky way or milk circle was just one of 11 circles greeks identified in sky others being zodiac meridian horizon equator tropics of cancer and capricorn arctic and antarctic circles and two colure circles passing through both poles astronomical history thumb shape of milky way as deduced from star counts by william herschel in 1785 solar system was assumed near center in meteorologica dk 59 aristotle 384 322 bc wrote that greek philosophers anaxagoras 428 bc and democritus 460 370 bc proposed that milky way might consist of distant stars aristotle with w d ross ed works of aristotle oxford england clarendon press 1931 vol iii meteorologica e w webster trans book 1 part 8 pp 39 40 2 anaxagoras democritus and their schools say that milky way is light of certain stars however aristotle himself believed milky way to be caused by ignition of fiery exhalation of some stars which were large numerous and close together aristotle with ross 1931 p 41 for it is natural to suppose that if motion of a single star excites a flame that of all stars should have a similar result and especially in that region in which stars are biggest and most numerous and nearest to one another and that ignition takes place in upper part of atmosphere in region of world which is continuous with heavenly motions aristotle with ross 1931 p 43 we have now explained phenomena that occur in that part of terrestrial world which is continuous with motions of heavens namely shooting stars and burning flame comets and milky way these being chief affections that appear in that region neoplatonist philosopher olympiodorus younger 570 a d criticized this view arguing that if milky way were sublunary it should appear different at different times and places on earth and that it should have parallax which it does not in his view milky way is celestial this idea would be influential later in islamic world persian astronomer abu rayhan al biruni 973 1048 proposed that milky way is a collection of countless fragments of nature of nebulous stars andalusian astronomer avempace 1138 proposed milky way to be made up of many stars but appears to be a continuous image due to effect of refraction in earth s atmosphere citing his observation of a conjunction of jupiter and mars in 1106 or 1107 as evidence ibn qayyim al 1292 1350 proposed that milky way is a myriad of tiny stars packed together in sphere of fixed stars and that these stars are larger than planets according to jamil persian astronomer nasir al din al tusi 1201 1274 in his writes milky way i e galaxy is made up of a very large number of small tightly clustered stars which on account of their concentration and smallness seem to be cloudy patches because of this it was likened to milk in color proof of milky way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when galileo galilei used a telescope to study milky way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars galileo galilei sidereus nuncius venice italy thomas baglioni 1610 pages 15 and 16 english translation galileo galilei with edward stafford carlos trans sidereal messenger london england rivingtons 1880 pages 42 and 43 in a treatise in 1755 immanuel kant drawing on earlier work by thomas wright thomas wright an original theory or new hypothesis of universe london england h chapelle 1750 on page 57 wright stated that despite their mutual gravitational attraction stars in constellations don t collide because they are in orbit so centrifugal force keeps them separated centrifugal force which not only preserves them in their orbits but prevents them from rushing all together by common universal law of gravity on page 48 wright stated that form of milky way is a ring stars are not infinitely dispersed and distributed in a promiscuous manner throughout all mundane space without order or design this phaenomenon is no other than a certain effect arising from observer s situation to a spectator placed in an indefinite space it i e milky way via lactea is a vast ring of stars on page 65 wright speculated that central body of milky way around which rest of galaxy revolves might not be visible to us central body a being supposed as i e an unknown without i e outside of finite view on page 73 wright called milky way vortex magnus great whirlpool and estimated its diameter to be 8 64x1012 miles 13 9x1012 km on page 33 wright speculated that there are a vast number of inhabited planets in galaxy therefore we may justly suppose that so many radiant bodies i e stars were not created barely to enlighten an infinite void but to display an infinite shapeless universe crowded with myriads of glorious worlds all variously revolving round them and with an inconceivable variety of beings and states animate speculated correctly that milky way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces akin to solar system but on much larger scales immanuel kant allgemeine naturgeschichte und theorie des himmels universal natural history and theory of heaven and leipzig germany johann friederich petersen 1755 on pages 2 3 kant acknowledged his debt to thomas wright dem herrn wright von durham einen war es einen zu einer zu thun welche von ihm zu gar zu absicht zu seyn und deren er nicht hat er betrachtete die fixsterne nicht als ein und ohne absicht sondern er eine systematische verfassung im ganzen und eine allgemeine beziehung dieser gestirne gegen einen der raume die sie to mr wright of durham an englishman it was reserved to take a happy step towards an observation which seemed to him and to no one else to be needed for a clever idea exploitation of which he hasn t studied sufficiently he regarded fixed stars not as a disorganized swarm that was scattered without a design rather he found a systematic shape in whole and a general relation between these stars and principal plane of space that they occupy resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on sky from our perspective inside disk kant also conjectured that some of nebulae visible in night sky might be separate galaxies themselves similar to our own kant referred to both milky way and extragalactic nebulae as island universes a term still current up to 1930s kant 1755 pages xxxiii xxxvi of preface ich betrachtete die art sterne deren herr von maupertuis in der abhandlung von der figur der gestirne und die die figur von mehr oder weniger offenen ellipsen vorstellen und mich dass sie nichts anders als eine fixsterne seyn konnen die abgemessene dieser figuren mich dass hier ein unbegreiflich und zwar um einen seyn weil sonst ihre gegen wohl aber nicht abgemessene figuren vorstellen ich auch ein dass sie in dem system sie sich auf eine seyn weil sie nicht sondern figuren und dass sie wegen ihres lichts unbegreiflich weit von uns i considered type of nebulous stars which mr de maupertuis considered in his treatise on shape of stars and which present figures of more or less open ellipses and i readily assured myself that they could be nothing else than a cluster of fixed stars that these figures always measured round informed me that here an inconceivably numerous host of stars which were clustered around a common center must be orderly because otherwise their free positions among each other would probably present irregular forms not measurable figures i also realized that in system in which they find themselves bound they must be restricted primarily to a plane because they display not circular but elliptical figures and that on account of their faint light they are located inconceivably far from us term weltinsel island universe appears nowhere in kant s book of 1755 term first appeared in 1850 in third volume of von humboldt s kosmos alexander von humboldt kosmos vol 3 stuttgart tubingen germany j g cotta 1850 pages 187 189 from page 187 thomas wright von durham kant lambert und auch william herschel waren die gestalt der und die der sterne in derselben als eine folge der gestalt und der weltinsel zu in welche unser ist thomas wright of durham kant lambert and first of all also william herschel were inclined to regard shape of milky way and apparent clustering of stars in it as a consequence of oblate shape and unequal dimensions of world island star stratum in which our solar system is included in english translation alexander von humboldt with e c otte trans cosmos new york city harper brothers 1897 vols 3 5 see page 147 first attempt to describe shape of milky way and position of sun within it was carried out by william herschel in 1785 by carefully counting number of stars in different regions of visible sky he produced a diagram of shape of milky way with solar system close to center william herschel 1785 on construction of heavens philosophical transactions of royal society of london 75 213 266 herschel s diagram of milky way appears immediately after article s last page see google books royal society of london in 1845 lord rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral shaped nebulae he also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae lending credence to kant s earlier conjecture thumb photograph of great andromeda nebula from 1899 later identified as andromeda galaxy in 1904 studying proper motions of stars jacobus kapteyn reported that these were not random as it was believed in that time stars could be divided into two streams moving in nearly opposite directions it was later realized that kapteyn s data had been first evidence of rotation of our galaxy which ultimately led to finding of galactic rotation by bertil lindblad and jan oort in 1917 heber curtis had observed nova s andromedae within great andromeda nebula messier object 31 searching photographic record he found 11 more novae curtis noticed that these novae were on average 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within milky way as a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150 000 parsecs he became a proponent of island universes hypothesis which held that spiral nebulae were independent galaxies in 1920 great debate took place between harlow shapley and heber curtis concerning nature of milky way spiral nebulae and dimensions of universe to support his claim that great andromeda nebula is an external galaxy curtis noted appearance of dark lanes resembling dust clouds in milky way as well as significant doppler shift controversy was conclusively settled by edwin hubble in early 1920s using mount wilson observatory hooker telescope with light gathering power of this new telescope he was able to produce astronomical photographs that resolved outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars he was also able to identify some cepheid variables that he could use as a benchmark to estimate distance to nebulae he found that andromeda nebula is 275 000 parsecs from sun far too distant to be part of milky way mapping esa spacecraft gaia provides distance estimates by determining parallax of a billion stars and is mapping milky way with four planned releases of maps in 2016 2018 2021 and 2024 see also baade s window galactic astronomy galactic center gev excess
