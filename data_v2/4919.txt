steeplechase park was an amusement park in coney island brooklyn new york created by entrepreneur george c tilyou steeplechase park operated from 1897 to 1964 it was first of three original iconic large parks built on coney island other two being luna park 1903 and dreamland 1904 of three parks steeplechase was longest lasting running for 67 years first rides in steeplechase park were standalone attractions scattered around coney island that tilyou had purchased in early 1890s steeplechase itself opened in 1897 to unite these formerly separate attractions and quickly gained popularity as a family friendly destination with exhibitionist and risque undertones it was destroyed by fire in 1907 but was quickly rebuilt steeplechase kept itself financially profitable as tilyou family continuously brought in new rides and new amusements to park such as parachute jump however by 1960s steeplechase park was becoming unprofitable due to high crime growth of suburban getaways and area s general trend toward residential development after park closed in 1964 developer fred trump purchased land and intended to develop it for residential use but this never came to pass and site was used for seasonal amusement rides during 1970s a dispute ensued over proposed use of steeplechase park site in 1980s and 1990s as two developers disagreed over whether to rebuild amusement park or build a sports complex on site eventually a minor league baseball stadium called keyspan park now mcu park was built in 2001 steeplechase plaza a portion of luna park 2010 that contains b b carousell is a homage to former steeplechase park today parachute jump is only remaining portion of former amusement park and new york city department of parks and recreation maintains land under mcu park as part of a greenspace called steeplechase park tilyou s early ventures steeplechase was created by george c tilyou 1862 1914 he had become familiar with coney island s economy from an early age when he was three years old his family started operating a popular coney island restaurant called surf house tilyou s first business venture was in 1876 at age of fourteen when he sold boxes of coney island sand and salt water to unwitting tourists for 25 cents each earning 13 45 in process tilyou later invested in stagecoaches and real estate before opening tilyou s surf theater coney island s first theater with his father in 1882 area outside theater became known as bowery street after bowery a notorious neighborhood in manhattan by 1887 tilyou was dealing primarily in real estate at time crime and corruption in coney island were prevalent when tilyou testified against john y mckane one of leaders of corruption he faced constant harassment until mckane was arrested in 1894 thumb right steeplechase married mary o donnell in 1893 and they went to visit world s columbian exposition in chicago for their honeymoon upon seeing fair s ferris wheel which contained 36 cars each with a 60 passenger capacity tilyou wished to buy it however since wheel had been sold already tilyou decided to build his own half size version at surf avenue on coney island tilyou s ferris wheel erroneously dubbed world s largest ferris wheel contained 12 cars each with a capacity of 18 passengers and soon became coney island s biggest attraction after noting that nearby sheepshead bay gravesend and brighton beach horse racing tracks were very popular tilyou added other rides and attractions on coney island peninsula tilyou came to own several rides including aerial slide bicycle railroad and double dip chutes however none of these rides were part of any single park and tilyou did not think to combine these rides into one park until opening of paul s sea lion park nearby in 1895 eventual creation of steeplechase park came after tilyou bought and improved steeplechase horses ride an attraction by j w that featured gravity pulled mechanical horses racing along metal tracks operation

in 1897 with completion of steeplechase horses attraction park covered an area of which tilyou owned two thirds outright other third was leased from huber family it was located at western end of bowery street steeplechase was approached by a grand stone archway on surf avenue to north top of archway decorated by four stone horses inclusion of a gateway along with a new 25 cent admission charge were intended to exclude seedier elements and make park a family destination drinking was prohibited as was gambling and prostitution park included over 50 attractions on its midway alone attractions included novelties such as human niagara a venetian gondola style ride aerial racing slide double dip chutes bicycle railway a french voyage panorama and a wild west sideshow tilyou also operated a small steam railroad a saltwater pool a ballroom and scenic railroad coaster by lamarcus thompson completing park were scale models of world landmarks such as eiffel tower and palace of westminster s clocktower containing big ben steeplechase pier a pier jutting into ocean was built to south of park in 1904 tilyou adopted a funny face mascot depicting a smiling man with several dozen teeth nicknamed tilly as icon for his park mascot which became a symbol of coney island represented area s wholesomeness and neoclassical architecture combined with its veneer of hidden sexuality in 1901 tilyou visited pan american exposition at buffalo new york to find additional rides for steeplechase park he approached fred thompson and skip dundy creators of popular a trip to moon ride to ask if they would bring their ride to steeplechase ride an indoor dark ride that simulated a space flight had been popular within exposition and thompson and dundy signed an agreement to relocate attraction to steeplechase for a year however a rainy 1902 season reduced profits of amusement park operators at coney island that year and forced closure of adjacent sea lion park thompson and dundy elected not to keep a trip to moon at steeplechase instead they moved attraction to their new park luna park which opened in 1903 season at site of sea lion park following luna park s success another amusement park on coney island dreamland opened in 1904 at coney island s peak in middle of 20th century s first decade three amusement parks competed with each other and with many independent amusements this was attributed partially to variety of transit options available by 1904 there were five railroads to coney island both luna park and dreamland had more expensive attractions than steeplechase park tilyou countered this by modifying and adding contraptions for his customers most of which carried an exhibitionist and risque undertone but were nonetheless popular despite their vulgarity entrance contained barrel of love a revolving drum that threw visitors onto each other other contraptions included human roulette wheel earthquake stairway dew drop and wedding ring all of these rides tossed riders around often on top of each other as they were designed under assumption that men and women wanted any excuses to grab onto each other success of steeplechase and other parks in coney island inspired tilyou to create additional amusement parks in new york city area and elsewhere in november 1904 tilyou announced that he would sell steeplechase park to a syndicate of investors for 1 25 million since he wanted to operate another amusement park in rockaway queens however sale of steeplechase was annulled in february 1905 after 50 000 had been paid since defective titles prevented syndicate from purchasing some of land under park from 1905 to 1907 tilyou refined steeplechase park with attractions such as a miniature railroad an orchestra stand cave of winds a fads and fantasy building limit building and a children s pony track limit building was short lived being replaced by monte carlo building in 1907 1907 fire and rebuilding in early morning of july 29 1907 a fire started within cave of winds attraction it spread quickly destroying most of wooden pavilions and hotels around bowery street however firefighters fought to save tilyou s house at corner of steeplechase park three alarm fire was extinguished after two hours but about of coney island was destroyed by fire steeplechase bore much of damage which was estimated at 1 5 million but several hotels were also ruined even though fire destroyed nearly everything within steeplechase park tilyou reportedly remained calm throughout even promising to host events that had been planned within park before fire morning after fire tilyou posted a sign outside park which read to enquiring friends i have troubles today that i had not yesterday i had troubles yesterday which i have not today on this site will be built a bigger better steeplechase park admission to burning ruins ten cents thumb a decorative indoor elephant in steeplechase s vast pavilion of fun by eugene 1910 brooklyn museum tilyou stated that park would be restored to a grander than ever condition but in meantime would erect temporary tent shows remaining attractions opened one week after fire ultimately park was rebuilt with fireproof steel and concrete structures because after fire municipality passed a law restricting construction of combustible wooden structures reconstruction of park was funded through a 2 million stock measure issued by steeplechase park company a business established in 1908 at start of 1908 season new york times described construction as being scarcely finished but also reported that large crowds flocked to attractions that had been rebuilt reconstruction of steeplechase park was completed in 1909 its main attraction was a pavilion of fun an indoor enclosure covered by steel and glass that measured with a total area of pavilion of fun was designed with several indoor rides so patrons seldom had to go outdoors it contained tawdry exhibitionist attractions reminiscent of previous iteration of steeplechase park such as human wheel human niagara mixer and grinder ferris wheel was salvaged from original park and was placed outdoors a new steeplechase horses attraction was built around pavilion but was designed such that riders had to exit through pavilion of fun steeplechase also included two new entrances a plaza overlooking a sunken garden palace of pleasure a ballroom and various sideshows other attractions included airships venetian gondolas and an automobile ride similar to that in first steeplechase park there were eight roller coasters inside rebuilt park as well similar to before fire admission was 25 cents a combo admission ticket entitled holder one experience on each of 25 attractions at steeplechase park 1910s and 1920s tilyou continued to add attractions to steeplechase in late 1900s and early 1910s he added first of several carousels to park in 1908 and world s largest swimming pool was completed following year tilyou opened a hall with an indoor swimming pool to west of pavilion in 1911 at which point he declared that he wanted to add one new ride per week several additional attractions were opened in 1912 including el dorado carousel and other structures salvaged from dreamland after it was destroyed in a 1911 fire in 1914 tilyou died leaving care of park to his children thomas f mcgowan then became general manager of park steeplechase would remain within tilyou family until it closed a half century later george s oldest son edward an 18 year old at time of his father s death constructed a skating rink at steeplechase in 1915 a racing derby carousel by master carousel builder marcus illions was added in 1920 and it featured 16 rows of four horses cycling up and down on small tracks within carousel shortly afterward edward tilyou also added a children s play area near southeast corner of park other attractions built in early 1920s included frolic spinning ride bumper cars swing and a caterpillar flat ride by early 1920s crowds at steeplechase and other coney island parks had become more mellow and orderly though beachfront in general was described as rundown steeplechase park started hosting several beauty contests near its outdoor pool providing more entertainment for park patrons these included modern venus bathing beauty contest first held in 1922 and grandma s beauty contest which started in 1932 this period also saw destruction of some structures such as upside down house burning down in 1911 additionally steeplechase lost its private beach during early 1910s following a 1912 lawsuit by new york state against tilyou and other amusement owners for taking private ownership of coney island s beach a judge ruled in 1913 that beach actually belonged to state an appellate court affirmed this decision in 1916 with an exception made for part of steeplechase park a plot of land granted by state prior to creation of park itself all obstructions on beachfront including a concrete walk within steeplechase were demolished in accordance with ruling boardwalk was opened on waterfront in 1922 in conjunction with boardwalk s opening city slightly relocated west 16th and west 19th streets at steeplechase park s eastern and western borders respectively which resulted in a slight expansion to steeplechase s area boardwalk s opening resulted in increases to real estate valuations at nearby areas such as steeplechase park though some lots were also taken from park to make way for new streets leading to boardwalk as a result a former brooklyn engineer alleged that tilyous lost money from relocation of west 16th and west 19th streets boardwalk s completion and a subsequent widening of surf avenue in 1924 prompted edward tilyou to make additional improvements to steeplechase park mid 1920s were described as golden age of roller coasters on coney island two gravity rides called zip and limit were constructed in steeplechase park and immediately to east independent ride operator george moran built thunderbolt roller coaster also built were a water ride called old mill tunnel of love and a noah s ark style attraction thomas mcgowan died unexpectedly in 1927 and was replaced by james j onorato following year one of pools was demolished and replaced with an attraction called hey day while a gas powered custer cars attraction was installed on boardwalk 1930s great depression through world war ii great depression resulted in significantly decreased attendance at steeplechase park before money ran out a one ring circus was constructed between limit coaster and an adjacent pool while a children s wading pool was constructed in addition a carousel was constructed at west 16th street in 1930 and whale and whip replaced noah s ark following year people still came to see beauty contests at steeplechase park in 1934 when finances slowly started to improve a bobsled roller coaster model called flying turns was installed at steeplechase several accidents and fires continued to occur at steeplechase a fire in july 1932 caused 1 5 million in damage and injured six people and left at least a thousand people homeless however steeplechase park and luna park were not as heavily damaged since fire was mostly concentrated to west there were other incidents as well in 1933 fifty seven people were hurt in a balcony collapse caused by overcrowding and three years later a barge crashed into steeplechase pier in addition patrons frequently received minor injuries such as friction burns though some people were thrown or fell from rides and one child died after falling off steeplechase horses in 1935 a conflagration in september 1939 caused 200 000 in damage and injured 18 people concessions on boardwalk were destroyed as was entrance to park from boardwalk and several attractions within park itself following year a new brick concession structure was built on site of old concessions and an express train ride was erected in front of pavilion upright thumb parachute jump acquired by steeplechase from 1939 new york world s fair still stands alt parachute jump ride 1939 new york world s fair in flushing meadows corona park several miles to northeast of coney island had created competition for coney island amusement parks which saw sharply reduced attendance steeplechase s situation was exacerbated by september 1939 fire which had destroyed many of larger attractions including flying turns after world s fair closed in 1940 tilyous purchased fair s parachute jump a parachute tower ride and moved it to former site of flying turns ride inspired by a training device for paratroopers opened in 1941 and contained 12 parachutes descending from a tower other rides were added at steeplechase in 1941 including rocket cars a whip ride and silver streak however draft during world war ii resulted in a shortage of qualified staff and in 1945 onorato closed pavilion of fun until end of war due to staff shortage 1940s and 1950s downfall despite park s popularity with new yorkers many factors after end of world war ii would eventually lead to its decline including frequent fires low patronage and white flight steeplechase s closest competitor luna park was heavily damaged by a pair of fires in 1944 luna park closed in 1946 leaving steeplechase as only major amusement park on coney island moreover after edward tilyou died in 1944 control of park was transferred to his siblings george jr frank marie and eileen who each owned a quarter share in steeplechase corporation relationship between siblings was fractious and they often argued about steeplechase s management in 1945 tilyou siblings leased out boardwalk carousel to their cousin james j mccullough next year they rented out pool which then instituted a season pass scheme that effectively locked out african americans from using pool despite fact that an increasing proportion of steeplechase visitors was african american ballroom was also split in half to create a tv studio in 1947 same year tilyou siblings discontinued combination ticket and started offering a pass where patrons could go on any 15 rides for one dollar in practice not many people bought 15 ride pass since various special interest groups such as social political and religious organizations had designated days where they could visit steeplechase park for free steeplechase also saw its 20 millionth visitor that year tilyous added extra rides for 1948 season including scrambler c cruise and several children s rides steeplechase park continued its downward trajectory with demolition of several rides and structures and neglect of others in december 1951 skating rink now used only for tilyou s private functions was demolished following year several structures on west 19th street were demolished as was little used old mill boat ride that ran under one of these structures site was filled by a parking lot in 1954 other impediments included a 1953 flood and fire which destroyed machinery death of tilyou siblings mother in 1954 which caused further acrimony among siblings and underpayment of employees which was one of main reasons employees were mostly elderly citizens who could afford to take such a low wage however park started becoming profitable again when arthur godfrey and his friends started broadcasting from steeplechase in 1955 after steeplechase pier was destroyed by fire in 1957 a larger replacement opened next year george tilyou jr died in 1958 and his sister marie took over as steeplechase corporation president next year demoting james onorato to general manager marie who had long wanted to change steeplechase s image against wishes of her brothers began adding rides for 1959 and 1960 seasons such as a tilt a whirl a round up ride and a paratrooper ride demise new york city parks commissioner robert moses was a longtime critic of coney island likening crowds that flocked there during summer months to a coffin as early as 1937 he had published a report about possible redevelopment of coney island moses who was also a new york city housing commissioner rezoned area for high rise housing in late 1940s subsequently in 1953 moses proposed that most of peninsula be rezoned for various uses claiming that it would be an upgrade over various business and unrestricted zones that existed at time steeplechase park would be allowed to remain open but much of shorefront amusements and concessions would be replaced by residential developments at time coney island was seeing fewer visitors year over year crime increases insufficient parking facilities bad weather and post world war ii automotive boom were cited as contributing factors in decrease of visitors to coney island start of 1964 new york world s fair also in flushing meadows corona park was another factor ironically prior to world s fair steeplechase park was seeing record high patronage highest single day visitor count over 18 000 customers was recorded in 1961 nevertheless it also faced problems of its own a severe assault of an employee in 1961 forced closure of while marie tilyou was opposed to her nephew frank ii s proposal to bring rides from century 21 exposition to park further steeplechase had been leasing one third of its land from huber family which decided to sell that land in 1962 more attractions were destroyed in a 1963 fire which razed two blocks on steeplechase s west side high crime was also rampant for instance a mass shooting nearby in 1962 resulted in three people being killed and visitors were generally afraid of being attacked by residents of nearby public housing projects by 1964 area had seen its lowest number of patrons in a quarter century by early 1960s children of george c tilyou began themselves to grow old his last surviving son frank died in 1964 shares of steeplechase park were now held by four women marie eileen and respective widows of frank and george jr all of whom had differing visions for park steeplechase park closed for season on september 20 1964 for what would be last time though no official closure announcement was made initially rumors of a sale started circulating in february 1965 on july 2 1965 property was sold to developer fred trump father of developer and future u s president donald trump who announced his intention to build luxury apartments on old steeplechase property though sale was opposed by coney island chamber of commerce it was consistent with area s gradual conversion into a residential community later use of site trump ownership and kaufman operation right thumb a 1973 photo of an abandoned giant slide that had been set up for a few years on old steeplechase site on site of steeplechase park fred trump proposed building a enclosed dome with recreational facilities and a convention center a plan which was supported by brooklyn borough president abe stark trump demolished steeplechase park s pavilion of fun during a highly publicized ceremony in september 1966 at demolition he was said to have sold bricks to ceremony guests to smash remaining glass windows on pavilion of fun trump supposedly destroyed pavilion to circumvent a landmark law being proposed by city following demolition of old pennsylvania station in 1963 in october 1966 city announced its plans to acquire of former steeplechase park so that land could be reserved for recreational use although residents supported city s action trump called city s proposal wasteful in january 1968 new york city parks commissioner august heckscher ii proposed that new york state government build an open space state park on steeplechase site and that may new york city board of estimate voted in favor of funding to buy land from trump condemnation of site started in 1969 city ultimately purchased proposed park s site for 4 million with partial funding from federal government as a condition of deal sale or lease of future parkland required permission from new york state legislature thus blocking trump from developing site as apartments trump filed a series of court cases related to proposed residential rezoning and ultimately won a 1 3 million judgment steeplechase park site laid empty for several years trump started subleasing property to norman kaufman who ran a small collection of fairground amusements on a corner of site calling his amusement park steeplechase park city also leased boardwalk and parking lot sites at extremely low rates which resulted in a 1 million loss of revenue over following seven years since city wanted to build state park on site of kaufman s steeplechase park it attempted to evict him by refusing to grant a lease extension city continued to pursue litigation over site occupied by norman kaufman for over ten years city was unsuccessful in its efforts it had no plan for proposed state park and in 1975 united states department of housing and urban development nearly withdrew a proposed grant of 2 million to fund proposed park city ultimately accepted grant however in june 1977 city s parks commissioner suggested that city would redevelop original steeplechase park s site as an amusement area instead of an open space state park and proposed that city return grant this move was opposed by chairman of new york city planning commission who wanted to use grant to pay for pedestrian walkways at steeplechase site in 1977 and 1978 kaufman withheld rent payments to city because of ongoing litigation and he sued city for 1 7 million by 1979 kaufman had expanded his park and had plans to eventually rebuild historic steeplechase park he had also bought back original steeplechase horse ride with plans to install it following season kaufman continued to operate site until end of summer 1980 in june 1981 city paid kaufman a million dollars for rides even though amusements were estimated to be worth much less than that however city had finally succeeded in evicting kaufman from property development as stadium in mid 1980s restaurant mogul horace bullard proposed rebuilding steeplechase park he had already bought several acres of property just east of steeplechase park site including site of defunct thunderbolt coaster and lots west of abe stark rink and planned to spend 20 million just on cleaning up neighborhood his plans called for using property bounded by west 15th and 19th streets between surf avenue and boardwalk to build a 55 million theme park based on original city agreed and project was approved in 1985 bullard planned to open park by mid 1986 to coincide with statue of liberty s centennial celebration however project was delayed while new york city planning commission compiled an environmental impact report by early 1987 cost of amusement park nearly doubled to 100 million

million 17 000 seat minor league baseball stadium near site state senator thomas attempted to block bullard from building on steeplechase site as he was part of an organization that had promised another developer sportsplex right to build an amateur sports arena on site construction was held up for another four years as bullard and sportsplex fought over site after rudy giuliani took office as mayor of new york in 1994 he negated bullard deal by approving construction of a minor league baseball stadium on site allotted for steeplechase park in 1998 giuliani had canceled sportsplex and entertainment complex and instead unveiled another plan where only parking lot would be built minor league team was called brooklyn cyclones bullard now no longer rebuilding steeplechase park had wanted to restore thunderbolt as part of a scaled down amusement park giuliani had coaster demolished on grounds that thunderbolt was about to collapse though coaster s destruction took weeks in 2000
