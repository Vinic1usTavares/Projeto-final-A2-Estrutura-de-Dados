grevillea juniperina commonly known as juniper or juniper leaf grevillea or prickly spider flower is a plant of family proteaceae native to eastern new south wales and south eastern queensland in australia scottish botanist robert brown described species in 1810 and seven subspecies are recognised one subspecies g j juniperina is restricted to western sydney and environs and is threatened by loss of habitat and housing development a small prickly leaved shrub between 0 2 and 3 m 8 in to 10 ft high g juniperina grows generally on clay based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland flower heads known as inflorescences appear from winter to early summer and are red orange or yellow birds visit and pollinate flowers grevillea juniperina plants are killed by bushfire regenerating afterwards from seed grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture as it is parent of many popular garden hybrids description grevillea juniperina has a spreading or erect habit growth form and it grows to between 0 2 and 3 m 8 in to 10 ft in height branchlets are thick and sturdy prickly leaves are generally stiff and are long and wide they are crowded along stems flowering occurs throughout year peaking between mid winter and early summer though varies between different subspecies subspecies allojohnsonii flowers from september to february subspecies trinervis flowers from august to december and subspecies juniperina amphitricha sulphurea villosa and fortis flower in august and september spider flower arrangement of inflorescence has several individual flowers emerging from a central rounded flower head reminiscent of legs of a spider flowers are red pink orange yellow or greenish and are mostly terminal arising on ends of stems though they occasionally arise from axillary buds they are long perianth is finely furred on outside while pistil is smooth it is long flowering is followed by development of seed pods each capsule is long and releases one or two seeds when ripe narrow oval seed is and wide with a swelling at apex and a short wing both surfaces are covered with tiny hairs similar species include wingello grevillea grevillea molyneuxii which can be distinguished by its prominent midvein on leaf undersurface and red spider flower g speciosa which has wider leaves with lateral veins and longer pistil taxonomy thumb right low spreading habit of a form growing in kanangra boyd national park alt low spreading shrub type specimen for this species was collected from port jackson area sydney district and was described by botanist robert brown in 1810 who gave it specific epithet juniperina which alludes to its juniper like foliage likewise it is commonly known as juniper or juniper leaf grevillea as well as prickly spider flower lectotype was selected by don macgillivray in 1993 from a collection by george caley in 1803 11 km 7 mi northwest of prospect in what is now sydney s outer western suburbs brown placed it in series lissostylis in his 1810 work prodromus florae novae hollandiae et insulae van diemen english botanist and explorer allan cunningham collected what he called grevillea sulphurea in 1822 near coxs river in bathurst area where it grew alongside g rosmarinifolia and g arenaria subspecies canescens this was later synonymised with g juniperina before being recognised as a distinct subspecies george bentham placed g juniperina in section lissostylis in his 1870 flora australiensis this section has become group of 45 species of shrub in southeastern australia within this group g juniperina is classified in speciosa subgroup five species of bird pollinated grevilleas found in eastern australia others are g molyneuxii g g and g speciosa there are seven subspecies of grevillea juniperina six of which have been recognised or described by bob makinson of new south wales herbarium in 2000 g juniperina subsp allojohnsonii makinson is found on northern tablelands and north west slopes in northern new south wales from north to tenterfield and stanhope and national park in southern queensland it is a prostrate shrub to 30 cm 12 in high with red flowers g juniperina subsp amphitricha makinson is a prostrate or spreading shrub with yellow or orange flowers that grows to tall and 3 m 10 ft wide it is found between braidwood and in shoalhaven river catchment on southern tablelands g juniperina subsp fortis makinson is a vigorous red flowered shrub growing to 1 3 m 3 10 ft tall that is found on rocky hills and slopes near watercourses specifically along ginninderra creek lower reaches of molonglo and cotter rivers and murrumbidgee river from pine island downstream to where it is joined by molonglo river mostly within australian capital territory g juniperina subsp juniperina is endemic to western sydney restricted to clay soils from blacktown west to penrith and marsden park and north to pitt town it is listed as a vulnerable species on schedule 2 of threatened species conservation act 1995 in new south wales its habitat is threatened by housing development road upgrading inappropriate fire regimes weed invasion rubbish dumping and trampling either by people or cars it grows as a spreading shrub that is 0 5 1 5 m 1 5 5 ft high g juniperina subsp sulphurea a cunn makinson formerly var is a shrub up to 2 m 7 ft high that grows on alluvial soils and along riverbanks it is found in catchments of coxs and shoalhaven rivers in central and southern tablelands from to berrima as well as to state forest in southwestern blue mountains it hybridises with g juniperina subsp trinervis in southern and western blue mountains g juniperina subsp trinervis r br makinson formerly grevillea trinervis is a prickly shrub with a spreading or prostrate habit ranging from 0 5 to 1 2 or rarely 2 m 20 in 7 ft high and yellow orange or red flowers it is found in western blue mountains g juniperina subsp villosa makinson is an upright red or yellow flowered shrub up to 2 m 7 ft high found along watercourses in eucalypt forest east and northeast of braidwood as well as in southeastern new south wales distribution and habitat unlike other proteaceae generally not found on clay soils grevillea juniperina subsp juniperina is found in cumberland plain and castlereagh woodland communities on clay loam soils growing alongside such species as forest redgum eucalyptus tereticornis mugga ironbark e thin leaved stringybark e broad leaved red ironbark e grey box e moluccana white feather melaleuca bursaria spinosa sickle wattle acacia and dillwynia grevillea juniperina subsp sulphurea is found on gravelly alluvial soil alongside leptospermum species and g juniperina subsp trinervis is found on alluvial soil with poor drainage in woodland or along riverbanks in association with snow gum eucalyptus pauciflora mountain gum e dalrympleana dillwynia and river lomatia lomatia annual rainfall in regions where g juniperina grows is 600 to 800 mm 24 32 in ecology killed by bushfire grevillea juniperina regenerates afterwards by seeds that germinate after lying dormant in soil stimulated by exposure to heat and smoke plants over 1 m 3 ft high produce more seed intervals of 10 to 15 years between fires are thought to be most beneficial for species survival as this allows seed numbers to build up in soil over time grevillea juniperina can also colonise disturbed areas though overgrowth of bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread grevillea juniperina is pollinated by birds with bees also recorded visiting flowers leaves are food for caterpillars of cyprotus blue candalides cyprotus a springtail species of australian origin was found on grevillea juniperina cultivated at

in 1831 it has been grown outdoors in southern england particularly g juniperina subspecies sulphurea grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and grows in a wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage long flowering it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter particularly for smaller birds such as finches many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold some having more horticultural appeal than others low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure new plants have same characteristics of parent direct contact with plant may cause a skin rash many cultivars have been selected for horticultural use either selected forms or hybrids with other grevillea species one prominent early breeder was leo hodge of w tree victoria hodge became interested in breeding grevilleas after finding seedlings in his garden his first trials involved crossing g juniperina with g victoriae producing g poorinda queen which was first to flower followed by g poorinda constance g poorinda leane and g poorinda pink coral respectively all in 1952 cultivars include allyn radiance derived from a prostrate orange and prostrate red forms of
