establish her as a known artist background after arranging a recording contract with a m records in 1982 for a then sixteen year old janet her father joseph jackson oversaw entire production of her debut album janet jackson and its follow up dream street 1984 latter of which was written and produced by jesse johnson and janet s brothers marlon and michael jackson was initially reluctant to begin a recording career commenting i was coming off of a tv show that i absolutely hated doing fame i didn t want to do first record janet jackson i wanted to go to college but i did it for my father and elaborated that she was often in conflict with her producers amidst her professional struggles she rebelled against her family s wishes by marrying james debarge of family recording group debarge in 1984 jacksons disapproved of relationship citing debarge s immaturity and substance abuse jackson left her husband in january 1985 and was granted an annulment later that year jackson subsequently fired her father as her manager and hired john mcclain then a m records senior vice president of artists and repertoire and general manager she also subsequently left jackson home in encino california and moved into her own apartment around this time commenting on decision she stated i just wanted to get out of house get out from under my father which was one of most difficult things that i had to do telling him that i didn t want to work with him again joseph jackson resented john mcclain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter s career out from under him mcclain responded by saying i m not trying to pimp janet jackson or steal her away from her father he subsequently introduced her to songwriting and production duo james jimmy jam harris iii and terry lewis former prince associates and ex members of time development and theme although joseph jackson initially demanded that his daughter s new album be recorded in los angeles so that he could keep an eye on her jam and lewis refused they required entire production of album to be done at their own studio in minneapolis minnesota far from glitter and distractions of hollywood and interference of manager fathers control was recorded at flyte tyme studios site for flyte tyme records founded by jimmy jam and terry lewis in minneapolis jackson recorded whole album but a m label executive and manager john mcclain wanted one more uptempo song to compose album she then went back to minneapolis to record one more track titled what have you done for me lately which was originally penned for one of jam and lewis s own records jam remembered she was sitting outside in lounge and said man that s a funky track who s that for and we said it s for you and she said oh cool i think she was very pleased when she heard track lyrics were rewritten to convey jackson s feelings about her recent annulment from james debarge it was last song to be recorded for control and was ultimately chosen as lead single for album as jam and lewis felt it best represented jackson s outlook on life i think it was very representative of sparseness and that rest of album had and attitude janet had about being in control being mature to point where she had definite opinions about what she wanted to say song was inspired by one of her experiences in minneapolis when a group of men made sexual advances towards her outside hotel she resided at during recording of control she recalled they were emotionally abusive sexually threatening instead of running to jimmy or terry for protection i took a stand i backed them down that s how songs like nasty and what have you done for me lately were born out of a sense of self defense composition musically what have you done for me lately is described as an uptempo dance song it begins with a conversation with one of her friends who asks jackson title question lyrically it involves singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was he was not treating her as well as he used to and she calls him a loser in response i never ask for more than i deserve you know it s truth you seem to think you re god s gift to this earth i m telling you no
