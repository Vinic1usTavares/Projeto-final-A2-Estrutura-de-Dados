closest forces were 24th infantry division headquartered in japan division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending regardless 24th was ordered to south korea 24th infantry division was first us unit sent into korea with mission to take initial shock of kpa advances delaying much larger kpa units to buy time to allow reinforcements to arrive division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay kpa making time for 1st cavalry and 7th and 25th infantry divisions along with other eighth army supporting units to move into position advance elements of 24th division were badly defeated in battle of osan on july 5 first encounter between us and kpa forces for first month after defeat of task force smith 24th division

mounting losses kpa force in west withdrew for several days to re equip and receive reinforcements this granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for attack on pusan perimeter naktong bulge about north of point where it turns east and is joined by nam river naktong river curves westward opposite yongsan in a wide semicircular loop for most of this span naktong is around wide and deep allowing infantry to wade across with some difficulty but preventing vehicles from crossing without assistance this perimeter was defended by a network of observation posts on high ground manned by 24th infantry forces in reserve would counterattack any attempted crossings by kpa artillery and mortar fire units were also deployed so large amounts of fire could be delivered on any one spot division

to block kpa advance to yongsan while 19th infantry was able to push it back and inflict substantial casualties however by evening of august 6 kpa held firmly on to their bridgehead attempted crossings that night were repulsed to south by republic of korea army rok forces but an unknown number of reinforcements were moved across river night of august 6 7 on august 7 8 kpa tried to move two more battalions across river to north but were repulsed by 21st infantry which was still in place kpa battalions were shifted south to cross at bridgehead instead by august 8 an estimated kpa regiment were across naktong counterattacks american counterattacks continued into morning of august 7 but gains were slow hampered by hot weather and a lack of food and water kpa were able to press forward and regain cloverleaf hill and oblong ni ridge critical terrain astride main road in bulge area by 16 00 that day 9th infantry regiment 2nd infantry division a unit newly arrived in korea was sent to region church immediately ordered it to attack kpa salient at bulge 9th infantry was fresh and well equipped they were also inexperienced many of their number being reservists despite a tenacious attack 9th infantry was only able to regain part of cloverleaf hill before intense fighting stalled its movement kpa forces began making gains in hills along river adjacent to their bridgehead against positions of 34th infantry coordinated attacks pushed a company to north back from their hills with heavy casualties on august 7 k company to south was also attacked but held its line reinforced by l company on august 10 fighting continued for several days resulting in heavy casualties as both sides captured and recaptured hills along naktong neither side able to gain a decisive advantage against other task force hill in an attempt to destroy kpa bridgehead church assembled a large force under 9th infantry regiment dubbed task force hill this force comprised 9th 19th and 34th infantry regiments as well as 1st battalion 21st infantry plus supporting artillery and other attached units it was assigned to drive kpa from east bank of river on august 11 commanding task force was colonel john g hill commanding officer of 9th infantry regiment kpa 4th division meanwhile had constructed underwater bridges of sandbags logs and rocks finishing first on august 10 4th division used it to move trucks and heavy artillery as well as additional infantry and a few tanks across river by morning of august 10 an estimated two kpa regiments were across river and occupying fortified positions supplies continued to stream in through rafts task force hill mounted its attack but was once again unable to make progress due to newly established artillery its directive to attack quickly became one to dig in and hold its ground and by nightfall entire kpa 4th division was across river on august 10 elements of kpa 4th division began to move south outflanking task force hill next day scattered kpa elements attacked yongsan kpa repeatedly attacked at night when american soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting reinforcements on august 12 general walton walker in command of eighth army dispatched part of 27th infantry regiment 25th infantry division to attack north from 25th division s zone to drive off kpa 4th division troops moving into yongsan simultaneously church assembled all combat service support soldiers he could and formed them into a combat unit to block further penetration of kpa forces which were setting up roadblocks on roads from yongsan thumb left

in as well as a battalion from 23rd infantry regiment 2nd infantry division these were able to push kpa infiltrators out of yongsan and back to their firmly held positions at cloverleaf hill on august 14 following an artillery barrage task force hill launched a direct assault on these positions fighting continued entire day in a fierce series of attacks and counterattacks in which both sides already at far reduced strength inflicted large numbers of casualties however task force hill s second attack was just as unsuccessful as its first casualties among officers was high in fight and disorganization that followed meant most of units in fight could not communicate to coordinate any large actions it became a battle of attrition by august 15 as neither kpa 4th division nor task force hill were able to get upper hand in fight which in several cases erupted in desperate hand to hand combat casualties mounted and a frustrated walker ordered 5 000 man 1st provisional marine brigade to area to turn tide brigade moved from masan region in middle of a counteroffensive being conducted by 25th us infantry kpa 4th division in meantime was suffering serious logistical setbacks from lack of food equipment ammunition and weapons conscripts from local south korean villages were brought in to replace mounting losses there was also virtually no provision for wounded in division and kpa forces began to come apart under these stresses still division s morale remained relatively high and general lee refused to withdraw destruction of bridgehead thumb alt a pair of heavily damaged tanks

at first tenacious kpa defense halted marines who responded with artillery raking cloverleaf hill heavy indirect fire forced kpa out of their positions before marines and task force hill eventually overwhelmed them one hill at a time marines approached obong ni first destroying resistance on slope with an airstrike and a barrage from us tanks but strong resistance caused heavy casualties and they had to withdraw kpa 18th regiment in control of hill mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing marines back division s tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise which had provided them so much success up to this point failed in face of massive us numerical superiority by nightfall on august 18 kpa 4th division had been annihilated huge numbers of deserters had weakened its numbers during fight but by that time obong ni and cloverleaf hill had been retaken by us forces scattered groups of kpa soldiers fled back across naktong pursued by american planes and artillery fire next day remains of 4th division had withdrawn across river in their hasty retreat they left a large number of artillery pieces and equipment behind which americans later pressed into service aftermath battle caused massive casualties for both sides by end of fight kpa 4th division had been completely destroyed with only 300 or 400 men in each of its regiments of its original 7 000 men division now had a strength of only 3 500 having suffered over 1 200 killed several thousand of members of division deserted during fight most of these men were south korean civilians forcibly conscripted into kpa 4th division would not recover until much later in war battle represented a new phase in war for kpa their numerical superiority was gone and their strategy of attacking supply lines and rear formations of us units was no longer effective without overwhelming numbers additionally advantage t 34 tank had once provided was also gone american units were now well equipped with effective anti tank weapons as well as larger numbers of tanks of their own subsequently all 4th division s t 34s were quickly knocked out before they could inflict much damage 9th infantry and
