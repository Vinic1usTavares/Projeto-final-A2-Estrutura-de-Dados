amanita muscaria commonly known as fly agaric or fly amanita is a basidiomycete of genus amanita it is also a muscimol mushroom native throughout temperate and boreal regions of northern hemisphere amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in southern hemisphere generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations and is now a true cosmopolitan species it associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees arguably most iconic toadstool species fly agaric is a large white gilled white spotted usually red mushroom and is one of most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture although classified as poisonous reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare after parboiling twice with water draining which weakens its toxicity and breaks down mushroom s psychoactive substances it is eaten in parts of europe asia and north america amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties with its main psychoactive constituents being compounds ibotenic acid and muscimol mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by indigenous peoples of siberia and by sami and has a religious significance in these cultures there has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as middle east eurasia north america and scandinavia taxonomy and naming name of mushroom in many european languages is thought to derive from its use as an insecticide when sprinkled in milk this practice has been recorded from germanic and slavic speaking parts of europe as well as vosges region and pockets elsewhere in france and romania albertus magnus was first to record it in his work de vegetabilibus some time before 1256 commenting fungus eo quod in it is called fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies ramsbottom p 44 thumb showing partial veil under cap dropping away to form a ring around stipe 16th century flemish botanist carolus clusius traced practice of sprinkling it into milk to frankfurt in germany while carl linnaeus father of taxonomy reported it from in southern sweden where he had lived as a child he described it in volume two of his species plantarum in 1753 giving it name agaricus specific epithet deriving from latin musca meaning fly it gained its current name in 1783 when placed in genus amanita by jean baptiste lamarck a name sanctioned in 1821 by father of mycology swedish naturalist elias magnus fries starting date for all had been set by general agreement as january 1 1821 date of fries s work and so full name was then amanita muscaria l fr hook 1987 edition of international code of botanical nomenclature changed rules on starting date and primary work for names of fungi and names can now be considered valid as far back as may 1 1753 date of publication of linnaeus s work hence linnaeus and lamarck are now taken as of amanita muscaria l lam english mycologist john ramsbottom reported that amanita muscaria was used for getting rid of bugs in england and sweden and bug agaric was an old alternative name for species french mycologist pierre bulliard reported having tried without success to replicate its fly killing properties in his work 1784 and proposed a new binomial name agaricus pseudo because of this one compound isolated from fungus is 1 3 1 3 di cis 9 glycerol which attracts insects it has been hypothesised that flies intentionally seek out fly agaric for its intoxicating properties an alternative derivation proposes that term fly refers not to insects as such but rather delirium resulting from consumption of fungus this is based on medieval belief that flies could enter a person s head and cause mental illness several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation meaning mad or fool s version of highly regarded edible mushroom amanita caesarea hence there is mad oriol in catalan from toulouse from department in southern france from trentino in italy a local dialect name in fribourg in switzerland is de which translates as devil s hat classification amanita muscaria is type species of genus by extension it is also type species of amanita subgenus amanita as well as section amanita within this subgenus amanita subgenus amanita includes all amanita with inamyloid spores amanita section amanita includes species with patchy universal veil remnants including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and veil remnants on cap to a series of patches or warts most species in this group also have a bulbous base amanita section amanita consists of a muscaria and its close relatives including a pantherina panther cap a gemmata a and a xanthocephala modern fungal taxonomists have classified amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural controversy thumb right upright amanita muscaria var formosa is now a synonym for amanita muscaria var guessowii amanita muscaria varies considerably in its morphology and many authorities recognize several subspecies or varieties within species in agaricales in modern taxonomy german mycologist rolf singer listed three subspecies though without description a muscaria ssp muscaria a muscaria ssp americana and a muscaria ssp flavivolvata however a 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of a muscaria by mycologist jozsef geml and colleagues found three distinct clades within this species representing roughly eurasian eurasian subalpine and north american populations specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in alaska this has led to hypothesis that this was centre of diversification for this species study also looked at four named varieties of species var alba var flavivolvata var formosa including var guessowii and var regalis from both areas all four varieties were found within both eurasian and north american clades evidence that these morphological forms are polymorphisms rather than distinct subspecies or varieties further molecular study by geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups plus a fourth associated with oak hickory pine forest in southeastern united states and two more on santa cruz island in california are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species thus a muscaria as it stands currently is evidently a species complex complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded as species a is a buff capped mushroom associated with conifers from pacific northwest and brown capped a and a from mediterranean basin and from sardinia respectively both of these last two are found with eucalyptus and cistus trees and it is unclear whether they are native or introduced from australia amanitaceae org lists four varieties but says that they will be segregated into their own taxa in near future they are image reference name common name synonym description amanita muscaria var muscaria euro asian fly agaric bright red fly agaric from northern

of fruiting body showing pigment under skin and free gills alt a white fleshed mushroom with a red skin cut in half a large conspicuous mushroom amanita muscaria is generally common and numerous where it grows and is often found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from soil looking like white eggs after emerging from ground cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid shaped warts these are remnants of universal veil a membrane that encloses entire mushroom when it is still very young dissecting mushroom at this stage reveals a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under veil which helps identification as fungus grows red colour appears through broken veil and warts become less prominent they do not change in size but are reduced relative to expanding skin area cap changes from globose to hemispherical and finally to plate like and flat in mature specimens fully grown bright red cap is usually around in diameter although larger specimens have been found red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms free gills are white as is spore print oval spores measure 9 13 by 6 5 9 mm they do not turn blue with application of iodine stipe is white high by wide and has slightly brittle fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms at base is a bulb that bears universal veil remnants in form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs between basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of partial veil which covers gills during development in form of a white ring it can be quite wide and flaccid with age there is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness although very distinctive in appearance fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in americas such as armillaria cf mellea and edible amanita a mexican species similar to a caesarea of europe poison control centres in u s and canada have become aware that spanish for yellow is a common name for a caesarea like species in mexico amanita caesarea is distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks numerous white warty spots of fly agaric furthermore stem gills and ring of a caesarea are bright yellow not white volva is a distinct white bag not broken into scales in australia introduced fly agaric may be confused with native vermilion amanita xanthocephala which grows in association with eucalypts latter species generally lacks white warts of a muscaria and bears no ring distribution and habitat left thumb a muscaria in a pinus radiata plantation near mount field national park tasmania amanita muscaria is a cosmopolitan mushroom native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout temperate and boreal regions of northern hemisphere including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as hindu kush mediterranean and also central america a recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in siberian beringian region in tertiary period before radiating outwards across asia europe and north america season for fruiting varies in different climates fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of north america but later in autumn and early winter on pacific coast this species is often found in similar locations to boletus edulis and may appear in fairy rings benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas p 305 conveyed with pine seedlings it has been widely transported into southern hemisphere including australia new zealand south africa and south america where it can be found in southern brazilian states of parana and rio grande do sul ectomycorrhizal amanita muscaria forms symbiotic relationships with many trees including pine spruce fir birch and cedar commonly seen under introduced trees a muscaria is fungal equivalent of a weed in new zealand tasmania and victoria forming new associations with southern beech nothofagus species is also invading a rainforest in australia where it may be displacing native species it appears to be spreading northwards with recent reports placing it near port macquarie on new south wales north coast it was recorded under silver birch betula pendula in manjimup western australia in 2010 although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in australia it has been recorded associating with them in portugal toxicity thumb upright mature white spots may wash off with heavy rainfall alt a tall red mushroom with a few white spots on cap amanita muscaria poisoning has occurred in young children and in people who ingested mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience occasionally it has been ingested in error because immature button forms resemble puffballs benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas pp 303 04 white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and mushrooms then may appear to be edible a caesarea amanita muscaria contains several biologically active agents at least one of which muscimol is known to be psychoactive ibotenic acid a neurotoxin serves as a prodrug to muscimol with approximately 10 20 converting to muscimol after ingestion an active dose in adults is approximately 6 mg muscimol or 30 to 60 mg ibotenic acid this is typically about amount found in one cap of amanita muscaria amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season which can further confuse issue spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings a fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas p 309 deaths from this fungus a muscaria have been reported in historical journal articles and newspaper reports but with modern medical treatment fatal poisoning from ingesting this mushroom is extremely rare many older books list amanita muscaria as deadly but this is an error that implies mushroom is more toxic than it is arora mushrooms demystified p 894 north american mycological association has stated that there were no reliably documented cases of death from toxins in these mushrooms in past 100 years active constituents of this species are water soluble and boiling and then discarding cooking water at least partly a muscaria drying may increase potency as process facilitates conversion of ibotenic acid to more potent muscimol benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas p 310 according to some sources once detoxified mushroom becomes edible pharmacology right thumb muscimol principal psychoactive constituent of a muscaria right thumb ibotenic acid a prodrug to muscimol found in a muscaria muscarine discovered in 1869 was long thought to be active hallucinogenic agent in a muscaria muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to excitation of neurons bearing these receptors levels of muscarine in amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as inocybe erubescens small white species c dealbata and c level of muscarine in a muscaria is too low to play a role in symptoms of poisoning benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas p 306 major toxins involved in a muscaria poisoning are muscimol 3 hydroxy 5 1 an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid and related amino acid ibotenic acid muscimol is product of decarboxylation usually by drying of ibotenic acid muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in mid 20th century researchers in england japan and switzerland showed that effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol not muscarine benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas pp 306 07 these toxins are not distributed uniformly in mushroom most are detected in cap of fruit a moderate amount in base with smallest amount in stalk lampe k f 1978 pharmacology and therapy of mushroom in rumack b h salzman e eds mushroom poisoning diagnosis and treatment crc press boca raton fl pp 125 169 quite rapidly between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted in urine of consumer almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten but muscimol is detectable in urine after eating a muscaria which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol ibotenic acid and muscimol are structurally related to each other and to two major neurotransmitters of central nervous system glutamic acid and gaba respectively ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters muscimol being a potent gabaa agonist while ibotenic acid is an agonist of nmda glutamate receptors and certain glutamate receptors which are involved in control of neuronal activity it is these interactions which are thought to cause psychoactive effects found in intoxication muscazone is another compound that has more recently been isolated from european specimens of fly agaric it is a product of breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra violet radiation muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with other agents amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective of vanadium some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants vanadium is present in fruit bodies as an organometallic compound called biological importance of accumulation process is unknown symptoms fly agarics are known for unpredictability of their effects depending on habitat and amount ingested per body weight effects can range from mild nausea and twitching to drowsiness cholinergic crisis like effects low blood pressure sweating and salivation auditory and visual distortions mood changes euphoria relaxation ataxia and loss of equilibrium like with tetanus in cases of serious poisoning mushroom causes delirium somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning such as that caused by datura characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion hallucinations and irritability followed by periods of central nervous system depression seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours but certain effects can last for several days in majority of cases recovery is complete within 12 to 24 hours effect is highly variable between individuals with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery treatment medical attention should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning if delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours activated charcoal is given gastric lavage can be considered if patient presents within one hour of ingestion inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended in any poisoning situation there is no antidote and supportive care is mainstay of further treatment for intoxication though sometimes referred to as a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from a muscaria and as such is its namesake muscimol does not have action either as an agonist or antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended if a patient is delirious or agitated this can usually be treated by reassurance and if necessary physical restraints a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness agitation muscular and seizures only small doses should be used as they may worsen respiratory depressant effects of muscimol recurrent vomiting is rare but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas p 313 serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma and may need intubation and artificial ventilation hemodialysis can remove toxins although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary with modern medical treatment prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment psychoactive use alt amanita muscaria in mount lofty south australia thumb photographed in mount lofty botanic gardens adelaide hills south australia wide range of psychoactive effects have been variously described as depressant sedative hypnotic psychedelic dissociative or deliriant paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia and may occur latter two effects may occur simultaneously and or as part of alice in wonderland syndrome collectively known as along with related distortions and some users report lucid dreaming under influence of its hypnotic effects unlike psilocybe cubensis a muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated due to its mycorrhizal relationship with roots of pine trees however following outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in united kingdom in 2006 sale of still legal a muscaria began increasing professor marija a renowned lithuanian historian reported to r gordon wasson on use of this mushroom in lithuania in remote areas of lithuania amanita muscaria has been consumed at wedding feasts in which mushrooms were mixed with vodka professor also reported that lithuanians used to export a muscaria to lapps in far north for use in shamanic rituals lithuanian festivities are only report that wasson received of ingestion of fly agaric for religious use in eastern europe siberia thumb amanita muscaria eastern siberia amanita muscaria was widely used as an entheogen by many of indigenous peoples of siberia its use was known among almost all of uralic speaking peoples of western siberia and speaking peoples of russian far east there are only isolated reports of a muscaria use among tungusic and turkic peoples of central siberia and it is believed that on whole entheogenic use of a muscaria was not practised by these peoples in western siberia use of a muscaria was restricted to shamans who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state normally siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing in eastern siberia a muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike and was used recreationally as well as religiously in eastern siberia shaman would take mushrooms and others would drink his urine this urine still containing psychoactive elements may be more potent than a muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching suggesting that initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in mushroom of eastern siberia have a story about fly agaric wapaq which enabled big raven to carry a whale to its home in story deity existence spat onto earth and his became wapaq and his saliva becomes warts after experiencing power of wapaq raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children people could learn from it ramsbottom p 45 among one report said that poor would consume urine of wealthy who could afford to buy mushrooms other reports of use finnish historian t i mentions that a muscaria was once used among sami people sorcerers in inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots in 1979 said mochtar and hartmut published an article in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a speaking group in afghanistan several asserted that amanita extract was administered orally as a medicine for treatment of psychotic conditions as well as externally as a therapy for localised frostbite there are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of a muscaria among two subarctic native american tribes ojibwa ethnobotanist reported its use among her people where it was known as this information was enthusiastically received by wasson although evidence from other sources was lacking letcher p 149 there is also one account of a euro american who claims to have been initiated into traditional tlicho use of amanita muscaria vikings notion that vikings used a muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first suggested by swedish professor samuel odmann in 1784 odmann s 1784 forsok at historia de gamla gang an attempt to explain berserk raging of ancient nordic warriors through natural history kongliga vetenskaps academiens nya handlingar 5 240 247 in wasson 1968 odmann based his theories on reports about use of fly agaric among siberian shamans notion has become widespread since 19th century but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers muscimol is generally a mild relaxant but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people it is possible that it could make a person angry or cause them to be very jolly or sad jump about dance sing or give way to great fright comparative analysis of symptoms have however since shown niger to be a better fit to state that characterises berserker rage fly trap amanita muscaria is traditionally used for catching flies possibly due to its content of ibotenic acid and muscimol recently an analysis of nine different methods for preparing a muscaria for catching flies in slovenia have shown that release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on solvent milk or water and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol in religion soma in 1968 r gordon wasson proposed that a muscaria was soma talked about in rigveda of india a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at time letcher p 145 he noted that descriptions of soma omitted any description of roots stems or seeds which suggested a mushroom and used adjective hari dazzling or flaming which author interprets as meaning red one line described men urinating soma this recalled practice of recycling urine in siberia soma is mentioned as coming from mountains which wasson interpreted as mushroom having been brought in with aryan invaders from north indian scholars santosh kumar dash and pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed using as a source letcher p 146 in 1971 vedic scholar john brough from cambridge university rejected wasson s theory and noted that language was too vague to determine a description of soma in his 1976 survey hallucinogens and culture anthropologist peter t furst evaluated evidence for and against identification of fly agaric mushroom as vedic soma concluding cautiously in its favour christianity thumb mosaic of red mushrooms found in christian basilica of aquileia in northern italy dating to before 330 ad philologist archeologist and dead sea scrolls scholar john marco allegro postulated that early christian theology was derived from a fertility cult revolving around entheogenic consumption of a muscaria in his 1970 book sacred mushroom and cross but his theory has found little support by scholars outside field of book was roundly criticized by academics and theologians including sir godfrey driver emeritus professor of semitic philology at oxford university and henry chadwick dean of christ church oxford letcher p 160 christian author john c king wrote a detailed rebuttal of allegro s theory in 1970 book a christian view of mushroom myth he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in middle east even though cedars and pines are found there and highlights tenuous nature of links between biblical and sumerian names coined by allegro he concludes that if theory were true use of mushroom must have been best kept secret in world as it was so well concealed for two thousand years letcher p 161 culinary use toxins in a muscaria are water soluble parboiling a muscaria can detoxify them and render an edible fruit body although its consumption as a food has never been widespread debbie further reflections on amanita muscaria as an edible species consumption of detoxified a muscaria has been practiced in some parts of europe notably by russian settlers in siberia since at least 19th century and likely earlier german physician and naturalist georg heinrich von langsdorff wrote earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823 in late 19th century french physician felix archimede pouchet was a populariser and advocate of a muscaria consumption comparing it to manioc an important food source in tropical south america that must be detoxified before consumption use of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in north america a classic description of this use of a muscaria by an african american mushroom seller in washington d c in late 19th century is described by american botanist frederick vernon coville in this case mushroom after parboiling and soaking in vinegar is made into a mushroom sauce for steak coville f v 1898 observations on recent cases of mushroom poisoning in district of columbia united states department of agriculture division of botany u s government printing office washington d c it is also consumed as a food in parts of japan most well known current use as an edible mushroom is in nagano prefecture japan there it is primarily salted and pickled a 2008 paper by food historian william rubel and mycologist david arora gives a history of consumption of a muscaria as a food and describes detoxification methods they advocate that amanita muscaria be described in field guides as an edible mushroom though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it authors state that widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a

mushroom in our own culture this is famous example from lewis carroll s alice in wonderland caterpillar sitting on mushroom alice bites a little piece of this to get larger smaller so there is some evidence that lewis carroll himself was aware of some of properties of eating these mushrooms and way in which it altered perception and so image of fly agaric became very common in victorian
