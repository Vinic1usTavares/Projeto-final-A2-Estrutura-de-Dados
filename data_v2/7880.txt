structure came from collection of george grey barnard an american sculptor and collector who almost single handedly established a medieval art museum near his home in fort washington section of upper manhattan although he was a successful sculptor who had studied at art institute of chicago his income was not enough to support his family barnard was a risk taker and led most of his life on edge of poverty he moved to paris in 1883 where he studied at academie des beaux arts he lived in village of moret sur loing near fontainebleau between 1905 and 1913 and began to deal in 13th and 14th century european objects to supplement his earnings in process he built a large personal collection of what he described as antiques at first by buying and selling stand alone objects with french dealers then by acquisition of in situ architectural artifacts from local farmers thumb upright george barnard and clare sheridan at his cloister in new york city 1921 barnard was primarily interested in abbeys and churches founded by monastic orders from 12th century following centuries of pillage and destruction during wars and revolutions stones from many of these buildings were reused by local populations a pioneer in seeing value in such artifacts barnard often met with hostility to his effort from local and governmental groups yet he was an astute negotiator who had advantage of a professional sculptor s eye for superior stone carving and by 1907 he had built a high quality collection at relatively low cost reputedly he paid 25 000 for trie buildings 25 000 for and 100 000 for cuxa cloisters his success led him to adopt a somewhat romantic view of himself he recalled bicycling across french countryside and unearthing fallen and long forgotten gothic masterworks along way he claimed to have found tomb effigy of jean d alluye face down in use as a bridge over a small stream by 1914 he had gathered enough artifacts to open a gallery in manhattan thumb left upright john d rockefeller jr in 1920 barnard often neglected his personal finances and was so disorganized that he often misplaced origin or provenance of his purchases he sold his collection to john d rockefeller jr in 1925 during one of his recurring monetary crises two had been introduced by architect william w bosworth purchased for metropolitan museum of art acquisition included structures that would become foundation and core of museum rockefeller and barnard were polar opposites in both temperament and outlook and did not get along rockefeller was reserved barnard exuberant english painter and art critic roger fry was then metropolitan s chief european acquisition agent and acted as an intermediary rockefeller eventually acquired barnard s collection for around 700 000 retaining barnard as an advisor in 1927 rockefeller hired frederick law olmsted jr son of one of designers of central park and olmsted brothers firm to create a park in fort washington area in february 1930 rockefeller offered to build cloisters for metropolitan under consultation with bosworth he decided to build museum at a site at fort tryon park which they chose for its elevation views and accessible but isolated location land and existing buildings were purchased that year from c k g billings estate and other holdings in fort washington area cloisters building and adjacent gardens were designed by

realized that collection offered works that could rival morgan collection in metropolitan s main building and that decision to form a treasury at cloisters was reached because it had been only
