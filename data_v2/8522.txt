independence pass originally known as hunter pass is a high mountain pass in central colorado united states it is at elevation on continental divide in sawatch range of rocky mountains pass is midway between aspen and twin lakes on border between pitkin and lake counties state highway 82 traverses it and after cottonwood pass to south is second highest elevation of a paved colorado state highway on a through road state highway 5 highest paved road in north america is a dead end route reaching just below summit of mount evans recently paved pikes peak highway is another dead end road and is only slightly lower with an elevation of on summit of mountain trail ridge road in rocky mountain national park part of u s highway 34 reaches a maximum elevation of it is also second highest pass with an improved road in state fourth highest paved road in state and second highest paved crossing of continental divide in u s because of heavy snowfall at its elevation it is closed in wintertime isolating aspen from direct access from east during ski season when pass is open in warmer weather it is a popular destination a scenic overlook near pass allows visitors to take in alpine tundra environment above treeline and offers excellent views to east of mount elbert colorado s highest peak and second highest mountain in contiguous united states rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation backcountry skiers make use of slopes during late spring and early summer since 2011 pass has been on route of usa pro cycling challenge pass was formed by glacial action and erosion in region and its first recorded sighting was by zebulon pike in 1806 ferdinand hayden surveyed it in 1873 as part of continental divide it was limit of european settlement in region at time with land to west reserved for ute people prospectors who defied governor frederick walker pitkin s order crossed pass on july 4 1879 giving it its current name and setting up a similarly named village now a ghost town to its west a toll road built across pass was abandoned and neglected after a railroad connection was made to aspen a new road replaced it in 1920s portions of old route can still be seen along western approach independence pass foundation based in aspen works to repair damage to pass s environment caused by both roads since 1984 geography at pass main ridge of sawatch range and thus continental divide turns from running generally south to more southwesterly north of pass slopes rise to an unnamed peak a half mile 1 km away a ridge of about same length connects it to nearest named summit twining peak to south ridge rises more gently around mountain boy gulch to an unnamed summit 2 miles 3 2 km distant first named summit in this direction is grizzly peak colorado s highest thumb left u s geological survey topographic map of pass alt a topographic map of pass showing highway 82 continental divide and national forest boundaries in red on a white background with green areas terrain is level enough and ridge broad enough to allow for a 500 foot 150 m parking lot along south side of highway 82 at height of land pass is split evenly between pitkin and lake counties as well as white river and san isabel national forests boundaries of collegiate peaks wilderness and mount massive wilderness are near pass on south and north respectively hunter fryingpan wilderness is also nearby west of parking area is a small maintenance shed on east are toilet facilities both are maintained by u s forest service a paved walkway system extends to a pair of overlooks 500 feet 150 m to south allowing views in that direction over lake creek valley to mount elbert at highest peak both in colorado and rocky mountains and la plata peak another and state s fifth highest peak a wide dirt path continues southward three miles 4 8 km along ridge to an unnamed summit across road a use path leads to summits of unnamed peak and twining pass comes roughly in middle of a stretch of highway 82 between two winter gates a corridor that is sometimes referred to in its entirety as independence pass aspen is to west with twin lakes to east beyond aspen highway continues down valley to mouth of roaring fork at glenwood springs east of twin lakes highway 82 continues a short distance to its eastern terminus at u s highway 24 south of leadville on both approaches dropoff is steep enough for highway 82 to require a 6 grade and switchbacks one on west and three on east former approach uses narrow valley of roaring fork river a tributary of colorado which rises from independence lake west of pass its walls are steeper but shallower than those of north fork of lake creek which drains into twin lakes reservoir and headwaters of arkansas river on east right thumb highway 82 and parking lot alt a road going through a mountainous area with no trees on left is a small pond on right is a parking lot with two buildings a brown and yellow sign in distance in parking lot reads independence pass divide while a blue one on very right says scenic overlook in white with an arrow pointing to right pass is above tree line so surrounding terrain is alpine tundra open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock particularly on steep slope to north snow lingers in some areas year round adjacent to road and parking area are small ephemeral pools on southwest with a larger permanent one north of road history like surrounding mountains pass was created by glaciation and erosion over thousands of years before european american settlers arrived it was in territory of ute native american tribe one of earliest sightings by a european american was in 1806 when zebulon pike mapping southern boundary of louisiana purchase spotted gap in what would later be named sawatch range from upper arkansas river valley it was not explored until ferdinand hayden and his team surveyed it in 1873 at time it was known as hunter pass three years later in 1876 colorado became a state at time settlement had pushed as far west from its capital denver as leadville there was a variety of metals and minerals in surrounding mountains and some miners had become rich from their claims there those who had not been so successful heard about reports from prospectors of abundant silver deposits further west over divide governor frederick walker pitkin had ordered all settlers to stay to east of divide as state and federal governments had not made peace with utes nevertheless some defied order drawn by prospect of mining fortunes settlers sometimes used hunter pass to get to ashcroft an early camp on castle creek above roaring fork however they preferred to take southern route over slightly higher cottonwood pass through taylor park and then back over taylor pass to get there even though this made for a 100 mile 160 km journey 40 miles 64 km more than direct route offered by hunter pass on july 4 1879 a group from leadville struck gold in uppermost roaring fork valley below pass four miles 6 4 km to west they established a settlement in upper roaring fork valley that eventually took name independence from holiday on which it was established pass lake from which roaring fork rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well twin lakes and roaring fork toll company established to build a road through to camps in lower roaring fork valley improved original path over pass sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses could be used for trip independence grew quickly when more gold was found in nearby mountains within two years of its settlement permanent buildings had replaced original tents and a mining concern from leadville had bought up all claims in two years they produced gold worth 190 000 in modern dollars funding construction of a stamping mill and sawmill in aspen further down valley silver was found in even greater abundance than independence s gold b clark wheeler an early investor in those mines funded construction of a stage road to leadville first road to cross pass it opened in november 1881 with winter already in full swing at pass road charged 25 cents in modern dollars for saddle horses and twice that for two axle stagecoaches tolls collected at three separate gates primarily reflected cost of retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep road open in wintertime they were able to keep road open through its first five winters when snow was too deep sleighs were used instead during summer stages were able to take switchbacks at full speed with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic a typical voyage over pass required 10 25 hours and five changes of horses gregory 1996 150 thumb left some of remaining buildings of independence 2010 alt two log cabins with metal roofs in distance down a rolling slope remains of another are partially visible closer to camera road improved independence s economy since coaches often stopped there on multi day journey however year of its construction would turn out to be settlement s economic peak year gold production dropped off after 1884 independence s decline in population remote location and severe high altitude winters cost it opportunity to be seat of newly formed pitkin county to aspen located on a larger plain further down river and growing much more rapidly due to colorado silver boom when a rail connection was made to that city in 1888 stage road fell into disuse further hurting independence s economy all but one of remaining residents decamped as a group to aspen on improvised cross country skis during severe winter of 1899 holdout j r williams remained until 1920 nearby williams mountains were named for him by then aspen s prosperity had receded as well congress repealed sherman silver purchase act in response to panic of 1893 which took largest buyer of city s silver out of market aspen began a period of steady decline known today as quiet years as mines gradually closed down route over pass remained useful however in 1895 a telephone line was routed over it although its population had dropped below a thousand by late 1920s in 1927 state replaced stage road with what eventually became highway 82 unlike stage road it was closed during winter months while most of old route was used for new road a portion of original grade remains three miles below pass on east side it includes foundation of gatekeeper s house and remains of gate during great depression another large public works project involved pass federal works progress administration wpa oversaw construction of twin lakes tunnel which diverted water from grizzly reservoir on lincoln creek a southern tributary of roaring fork to twin lakes where it was used for irrigation purposes by beet and watermelon farmers in rocky ford and ordway areas starting in 1935 50 000 acre feet about 61 7 million m3 were made available this way thumb right view of la plata peak from pass alt a view of mountainous terrain with a forested valley at bottom rising to bare slopes with snowfields higher up in center one peak stands higher than others another wpa effort recognized pass as a scenic attraction a travel guidebook for automobile touring produced by federal writers project gave as one route trip along highway 82 from twin lakes it noted distinctive landscape of pass after world war ii aspen began to grow and prosper again due to establishment of a popular ski resort an annual music festival and a relaxed lifestyle which attracted many celebrities and corporate executives to city visitors to aspen generally had to take highway 82 up from glenwood springs or fly in as few wanted to drive over unpaved pass road in 1967 state highway department remedied this by paving road over pass it has since been designated part of colorado s top of rockies scenic byway by state and federal departments of transportation environment alpine biome of pass extends below it on either side to an elevation of approximately or about altitude of lake trailhead on western side highway 82 s uppermost crossing of roaring fork below it is a subalpine zone where lodgepole pine engelmann spruce subalpine fir and aspen dominate forest a few patches of those trees persist above that elevation but they are mostly stunted thumb left alpine tundra and pool south of pass alt a grassy yet barren landscape with a small pond in right foreground and distant ridgeline and mountains in background tree growth above those patches is curtailed by alpine climate of pass it is characterized by severe changes in temperature high winds and deep winter snow resulting short growing season is made even shorter by thin soil most predominant plant species in alpine zone around pass are grass species adapted to harsh climate other alpine flora such as moss and lichens on rocks and wildflowers in season make appearances shrubs that survive among them include strawberry snowberry willows and bog birch animals in alpine zone include small burrowing species like pika marmots and pocket gopher and mountain goats two types of rock are found in pass and its vicinity quartz forms many of cliffs while crags are biotite gneiss glaciation which dates to as recently as 12 000 years ago smoothed much of rock to point of it being slippery visitor attractions thumb right scenic overlook with view southeast alt a small paved area encircled by a guardrail with wooden posts and ropes people are standing in it looking at high snow capped mountains in distance many visitors stop at parking lot and walk paved path to scenic overlook in clear enough weather it offers views east of mount elbert colorado s highest peak and la plata peak state s fifth highest at to west more fourteeners maroon bells snowmass mountain and capitol peak stand out among mountains a trail with braille interpretive plaques is available for visually impaired visitors other outdoor recreation opportunities exist at and near pass between pass and difficult campground 3 miles 4 8 km east of aspen there are many popular rock climbing areas some with grades up to 5 12 under yosemite decimal system green 1995 rock climbing 309 319 grotto wall across from lincoln gulch campground is a frequent destination closer to pass are instant karma cliff and s dome a pair of rocks along either side of highway 82 on east approach to pass are popular bouldering spots on days after pass reopens in spring backcountry skiers often take advantage of remaining snow on slopes in years following heavy winters skiing is possible into july thumb left swimmers at devil s punchbowl alt two shirtless men in dark shorts stand with their backs to camera behind them is a large area with rocky cliffs and deep water across it several other people similarly attired are standing water based recreation is available near pass as well particularly on roaring fork side at grottos climbing cliffs eight miles 14 4 km to west of pass a short trail leads to an area along river known as devil s punchbowl with high stone cliffs on either side and waterfalls it is a popular swimming hole due to its deep and cool waters river is popular with anglers casting for trout as well and some even make hike from pass up to blue lake for its lake and cutthroat trout stocks four miles 6 4 km west of pass is site of independence village whose establishment on july 4 led to pass s current name it has been a ghost town since early 20th century in 1973 it was listed on national register of historic places most of its buildings were cannibalized for their building supplies but a few log cabins remain aspen historical society in conjunction with u s forest service built an interpretive trail with plaques in 2011 usa pro cycling challenge bicycle race around colorado was held for first time a stage from gunnison to aspen was routed over both cottonwood and independence passes spectators were allowed to camp at pass their impact on pass s environment led to a ban on camping within 10 miles 16 km of it for following year s event forest service posted signs reminding spectators at pass of fragility of surrounding tundra travel advisories and restrictions colorado department of transportation cdot restricts use of highway 82 through pass most significant is winter closure road is typically closed after first significant winter snowfall or by november 7 at latest but there have been exceptions http www denverpost com 2016 11 15 independence pass close cdot tries to reopen just before memorial day weekend in late may traditional beginning of summer in united states when enough of accumulated snowpack has melted to make it possible to clear and repair road some years after light winters pass has reopened as early as may 12 two gates just east of aspen on west end and west of remaining buildings of stage stop of everett on east prevent motor vehicles from passage when road is closed aspen is isolated from east and highway 82 up valley from glenwood springs becomes only vehicular access to city during its busy ski season right thumb switchback on east approach alt a sharply curved section of road viewed from above in a steeply sloped area with large evergreen trees even when pass is open not all vehicles may use road oversized and overweight vehicles are prohibited from pass as are all vehicles or vehicle combinations longer than regardless of weight or size this precludes use of pass by tractor trailers buses and recreational vehicles some truck drivers use pass despite prohibition they are generally either unaware of restriction and following routes plotted by their gps devices or aware of it and willing to risk fine for sake of time and distance saved resulting accidents have sometimes forced closure of pass cdot put up larger signs advising drivers of ban and worked with gps device manufacturers so their software notes restriction aspen officials have suggested increasing fines as a deterrent thumb left snow single lane sections and steep are among many hazards encountered on highway 82 through pass alt a snow covered road next to a rocky cliff face on right with only fog visible on left ahead is a temporary traffic light showing red driving through pass is challenging both approaches require 6 grades due to height of pass and require navigating hairpin turns with advisory speeds of 10 mph 15 km h rockfalls particularly on approach from aspen have narrowed some sections to a single lane 12 feet 4 m wide with temporary traffic lights on twin lakes approach they have resulted in temporary closures other vehicles frequently enter road unexpectedly at many parking areas for campgrounds and other recreational attractions and bicyclists make frequent use of highway 82 as well lastly weather at pass can be unpredictable and vary considerably from conditions in either aspen or twin lakes there may be thunderstorms on otherwise clear days and snow can occur at any time of year cdot advises anyone coming to pass for outdoor recreation to take precautions against effects of high altitude and changeable weather independence pass foundation since days of stage road avalanches and rockfalls often forced closures of highway partly due to massive disturbance of land during road s construction no attempt was made to remedy this until shortly after automobile road was built in 1930s as a relief project during great depression a crew from civilian conservation corps replanted slopes around independence by then abandoned for two decades interpretive plaque at independence ghost town site at that time aspen was a faded mining town whose population had dwindled to fewer than a thousand later in decade first efforts to develop a ski resort began they continued after world war ii and in later decades of 20th century city began to grow again other than paving road cdot was unable to undertake any significant improvements to highway corridor due to its projects elsewhere in state and requirement to coordinate efforts with forest service which owns most of damaged land beginning in 1976 bob lewis an environmental activist in aspen organized revegetation efforts on some sections of pass near road that were having serious erosion problems he realized eventually that a dedicated nonprofit organization would be a better way to address many issues that remained independence pass foundation ipf was established in 1989 its first project coordinated with forest service cdot and pitkin county was reconstruction of a curve near popular weller lake trailhead success of weller curve project cleared way for work on top cut stretch just below summit on western side which includes most seriously eroded slopes anywhere in pass corridor lewis had always intended to focus ipf s efforts on it and organization began first of several ongoing projects there in 1996 work included construction of stone retaining walls as well as revegetation by 2010s results were evident with success of these projects ipf has been doing revegetation projects along road below top cut since 2004 compost blankets were applied to large sections of soil to replace lost nutrients in 2009 foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in soil just below pass summit during 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by twin lakes tunnel they were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to wilderness area restrictions last fence material was removed in 2012 ipf has undertaken other projects to promote awareness of work that needs to be done at pass to protect its distinctive environment groups from local schools have spent a day up in pass working and learning many have adopted same sites and work on them with a new class each year along with aspen center for environmental studies foundation also cosponsors a my independence all day walking tour of pass for adults that covers ecological topics in depth every may since 1994 just before cdot reopens pass foundation holds its popular ride for pass a charity bicycle race that serves as a major outreach event and fundraiser it follows a route from gate east of aspen to independence townsite climbing in process ipf has canceled it twice due to poor weather see also colorado mountain passes list of mountain passes list of rocky mountain passes on
