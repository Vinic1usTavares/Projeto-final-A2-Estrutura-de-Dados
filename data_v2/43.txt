operation fustian was an airborne forces operation undertaken during allied invasion of sicily in july 1943 in second world war operation was carried out by brigadier gerald lathbury s 1st parachute brigade part of british 1st airborne division their objective was primosole bridge across simeto river intention was for brigade with glider borne forces in support to land on both sides of river they would then capture bridge and secure surrounding area until relieved by advance of british xiii corps which had landed on south eastern coast three days previously because bridge was only crossing on river and would give british eighth army access to catania plain its capture was expected to speed advance and lead to defeat of axis forces in sicily many of aircraft carrying paratroopers from north africa were shot down or were damaged and turned back by friendly fire and enemy action evasive action taken by pilots scattered brigade over a large area and only equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in correct locations despite this and defence by german and italian forces british paratroops captured bridge repulsed attacks and held out against increasing odds until nightfall relief force led by 50th northumbrian infantry division under major general sidney c kirkman which was short of transport were still away when they halted for night by this time with casualties mounting and supplies running short parachute brigade commander gerald lathbury had relinquished control of bridge to germans following day british units joined forces and 9th battalion durham light infantry with tank support attempted to recapture bridge bridge was not finally secured until three days after start of operation when another battalion of durham light infantry led by paratroopers established a bridgehead on north bank of river capture of primosole bridge did not lead to expected rapid advance as by this time germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line it was not until early following month that eighth army captured catania by this time 1st parachute brigade had been withdrawn to malta and took no further part in conquest of sicily lessons were learned from operation and were put into practice in allied airborne operations background after axis powers were defeated in north africa allied armies next logical objective was to cross mediterranean landing in either south of france balkans sicily or italy objective chosen was sicily with landing scheduled for 10 july 1943 tugwell p 156 allied 15th army group commanded by general sir harold alexander consisted of american seventh army commanded by lieutenant general george patton which would land in west between licata and scoglitti and veteran british eighth army commanded by experienced general bernard montgomery which would land in south east between cape passero and syracuse thumb map of july 1943 allied landings in sicily in addition to seaborne landings there were also airborne landings during invasion u s 82nd airborne division under major general matthew ridgway would land in support of seventh army while british 1st airborne division under major general george hopkinson conducted brigade sized landings along eastern coast to support eighth army first british airborne landing was operation ladbroke which was carried out by 1st airlanding brigade under brigadier philip hicks during night of 9 10 july their objective was to seize and hold ponte grande bridge just outside syracuse reynolds p 36 second british airborne mission operation glutton was to have been undertaken by 2nd parachute brigade under brigadier ernest down on night of 10 11 july aiming to capture a bridge beside augusta however circumstances changed and second operation was cancelled third british airborne mission planned was operation fustian to be carried out by 1st parachute brigade under brigadier gerald lathbury and scheduled for night of 13 14 july 1st parachute brigade s objective was primosole bridge crossing simeto river south of catania tugwell p 159 bridge was a vital objective as it was only crossing point over simeto its capture would give eighth army access to catania plain to enable them to continue their advance northwards its destruction would seriously hamper advance reynolds p 37 once parachute brigade had captured bridge they would then have to defend it until relieved by units of eighth army advancing from landing beaches tugwell p p 47 british forces 1st parachute brigade under brigadier lathbury comprised 1st 2nd and 3rd parachute battalions 16th parachute field ambulance 1st parachute squadron royal engineers and 1st airlanding anti tank battery royal artillery airlanding anti tank battery were equipped with 1st para brigade s only anti tank guns british 6 pounder despite formation being a parachute brigade only way to transport anti tank guns and jeeps required to pull them when they had landed was by glider cole p 35 transporting artillery by air was something new to british or any other army and this would be first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat carman p 23 1st parachute brigade was an experienced formation initially under command of 1st airborne division before being detached from division to fight in north africa brigade had taken part in landings in algeria in november 1942 and subsequent battle of tunisia during which each of brigade s three parachute battalions had taken part in their own battalion sized parachute landings reynolds pp 30 32 it was during this campaign that 1st parachute brigade had been given their nickname red devils by germans reynolds p 34 a british parachute battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three rifle companies each of companies were divided into a small headquarters and three platoons platoons had three sections each section had a bren machine gun and a 2 inch mortar as well as men s own personal weapons guard p 37 only heavy weapons in parachute battalion were in 3 inch mortar platoon and vickers machine gun platoon which were part of battalion headquarters peters and buist p 55 thumb british paratroopers before taking part in a practice parachute jump in april 1944 it was decided that brigade s paratroops would land on four separate drop zones and that gliders would land at two landing zones paratroops of 1st parachute battalion were divided into two groups one of which would land at drop zone one to north of river and second at drop zone two to south of it once they had landed two groups would head for their assembly points before conducting an assault on bridge from both sides simultaneously 2nd parachute battalion were to be landed south of bridge on drop zone three in area between gornalunga canal and main highway mrazek p 83 2nd battalion then had to assault and occupy three small hills which had been given codenames johnny i johnny ii and johnny iii hills were believed to be occupied by an italian force of around platoon strength once battalion had secured three hills they were to dig in and prepare to defend hills against an attack from south 3rd parachute battalion would land at drop zone four north of bridge their objective was to secure ground in this area defending against any counterattack from direction of catania brigade s glider force had two landing areas landing zone seven north of river and landing zone eight south of river owing to complexity of landing plan and short time between inception and execution pathfinders belonging to 21st independent parachute company army air corps would be deployed to mark correct drop zones this was first occasion this had been done in british airborne operations tugwell p 163 pathfinder company had special marker lights and rebecca and eureka beacons that transport aircraft and gliders would be able to identify and home in on ferguson p 12 senior officers of 1st airborne division had estimated that there would be around 450 casualties during capture of bridge of which 25 per cent would be killed or missing and other 75 per cent wounded it was appreciated that by themselves three battalions medical officers and staff would be unable to cope with expected numbers of casualties so one section from 16th parachute field ambulance consisting of one doctor and 16 other ranks would be attached to each of parachute battalions remainder of field ambulance comprising headquarters with two surgical teams would be co located with brigade and establish their main dressing station in farm buildings to south of bridge cole p 45 after problems with first two airborne operations in sicily royal air force advisor assigned to 1st airborne division suggested that american c 47 pilots adopt royal air force bomber stream formation this entailed aircraft flying in pairs one behind other with one minute between each aircraft instead of flying in their normal v formation suggestion was dismissed by american pilots who were mostly pre war airline pilots not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and inexperienced crews relied heavily on following aircraft in front tugwell p 164 unconnected with operation fustian but being conducted at same time no 3 commando would carry out a separate operation to south of simeto river commando unit were to carry out an amphibious landing from sea then assault and capture malati bridge over leonardo river mitcham p 150 thumb sicily 1943 british infantry with a sherman tank to their rear relieving force for both commandos and paratroopers would be from british xiii corps commanded by lieutenant general miles c dempsey corps consisted of 5th infantry division 50th northumbrian infantry division and 4th armoured brigade armoured brigade with three tank regiments was equipped with american built sherman tank mitcham p 335 early on 13 july commander of 50th division major general sidney c kirkman was called to general montgomery s eighth army headquarters here he was informed about two missions by british commandos and 1st parachute brigade and requirement for bridges to be captured intact montgomery s intention was for 50th division to lead eighth army s advance and relieve commandos and paratroopers to assist kirkman in task montgomery placed 4th armoured brigade under his command mitcham p 154 montgomery was insistent that he wanted infantry division to relieve parachute brigade early on 14 july which would require division to advance around in 24 hours 50th division had landed on 10 july and by this time had been fighting for three days non stop with daily temperature most of time reaching many of men in division were physically exhausted and suffering from heat exhaustion division s situation was not improved by a grave error of judgement by montgomery during planning for invasion he had overestimated strength of german and italian resistance to allied landings british eighth army consisted mainly of infantry tanks and heavy weapons but were light on any form of mechanical transport so any advance by 50th division would have to be conducted on foot mitcham p 82 axis forces italian army force in area of primosole bridge came from 213 coastal division commanded by general carlo gotti coastal divisions were second line divisions usually formed from men in their forties and fifties and were intended to perform labour or other second line duties recruited from local population their officers were mostly men who had retired but had then been called up again their morale was low not least because of their second rate equipment and weapons it had been intended to improve their armaments with equipment seized from recently disbanded vichy french army but when arms arrived in sicily many of them had been made unusable and some had wrong type of ammunition or no ammunition at all jowett p 6 thumb german fallschirmjager of fallschirmjager regiment 1 in oslo 1940 italians were supported by german paratroopers of 1st parachute division who were ordered to move to sicily from france and if necessary were to parachute in on 9 july mitcham p 72 1st fallschirmjager machine gun battalion commanded by major werner schmidt had landed at catania during an allied air raid early on 13 july their aircraft and anti tank guns were destroyed during raid so battalion left on foot for primosole bridge when schmidt informed divisional commander of his intentions he was warned to expect a sea or airborne landing that night if allies landed to rear of division schmidt s battalion had to hold primosole bridge so that division could escape mitcham pp 150 151 forewarned in this way machine gun battalion started to dig in and prepare a defence around to south of bridge once they arrived well located to deal with any parachute or glider landing in that area mitcham p 151 primosole bridge primosole bridge is built from steel girders it has a span of and is raised above simeto river land to north of bridge is mainly olive and almond groves in tree lined fields immediately to south of bridge is gornalunga canal and beyond that three prominent hills road crossing bridge is highway 114 running from lentini to south to to north to assist italians defending bridge four pillbox bunkers had been constructed two on north bank and two on south bank mitcham pp 157 158 fustian at 19 30 on 13 july 1943 first aircraft carrying 1 856 men of 1st parachute brigade took off from north africa mitcham p 148 aircraft used consisted of 105 douglas c 47 skytrains belonging to 51st troop carrier wing 51 each from 60th and troop carrier groups while 64th troop carrier group supplied other three no 38 wing royal air force supplied eleven armstrong whitworth albemarles mrazek p 82 following behind parachute force were glider towing aircraft these aircraft again supplied by no 38 wing comprised 12 albemarles and seven handley page halifaxes towing 11 horsa gliders and eight waco gliders gliders were used to carry 77 men mostly from anti tank battery ten 6 pounder anti tank guns and 18 jeeps thumb a pair of c 47 skytrains similar to 105 c 47s used in operation aircraft s flight path took them around south eastern corner of malta and up eastern coast of sicily route was measured to ensure that first planes arrived over drop zones at 22 20 when planes arrived off sicily they were supposed to stay offshore until reaching simeto river when they would head inland for drop zones mrazek p 84 somehow 33 aircraft strayed off course and approached an allied convoy naval gunners had been warned to expect an air raid and opened fire on american and british aircraft two of planes trying to avoid unexpected anti aircraft fire collided and crashed into sea another two were shot down and nine were so badly shot up with wounded crew and passengers that they were forced to turn back towards their airfields in north africa those aircraft that did reach sicilian coast were engaged by axis anti aircraft guns which shot down 37 of them another ten were damaged and were forced to abort their mission some of inexperienced pilots now refused to go any further and on his aircraft lieutenant colonel alastair pearson commanding officer of 1st parachute battalion realising his plane was flying round in circles had to threaten to shoot crew to make them continue anti aircraft fire and evasive action taken by pilots had dispersed aircraft formations and parachute drop was scattered over a large area violent evasive manoeuvring left some of paratroopers in heaps on aircraft floor and they were unable to jump when ordered when safely back out to sea some of pilots refused to try again considering risk too great cole p 46 of surviving aircraft which carried on with mission only 39 managed to drop their paratroops within of correct drop zone furthest off course were some groups from 3rd parachute battalion and royal engineers who landed to south of bridge cole p 47 while another four aircraft landed their paratroops on slopes of mount etna to north those men of 1st parachute brigade that landed on southern drop zone were well within range of 1st fallschirmjager machine gun battalion in darkness germans initially thought that paratroopers were their own reinforcements landing but they soon realised their mistake and opened fire some of those who escaped machine gun fire were rounded up on drop zone and about 100 of them became prisoners of war as soon as they had touched ground mitcham p 152 in confusion of landing 50 men of 1st parachute battalion had assembled assaulted and managed to capture bridge before 50 italian defenders could destroy it with attached demolition charges italians were taken prisoner just as a second group of 40 paratroopers led by brigadier lathbury arrived at bridge lathbury organised safe removal of demolition charges and set up a defensive perimeter more paratroopers continued to gather at bridge and soon they numbered around 120 men who dug in to north and south brigade headquarters and field ambulance main dressing station were established to south of bridge where brigade s casualties started arriving for treatment away from main dressing station medics on 2nd battalion drop zone had 29 wounded as a result of parachute drop and there were 15 wounded on drop zone one from 1st battalion cole pp 47 48 thumb british paratroopers advance in line abreast first glider casualties had occurred on take off when two aircraft towing waco gliders crashed while en route one of gliders was released early by its towing aircraft and crashed into sea when they did arrive over sicily element of surprise was gone and four gliders were shot down by coastal anti aircraft batteries by time gliders arrived at their landing zones two hours had lapsed since parachute landings had started one glider pilot later commented that they did not need pathfinders as tracer and lights from explosions were brighter than any of landing markers of surviving glider force only four gliders managed to land relatively unscathed all others being caught by fallschirmjager machine gun fire and destroyed on their approach four intact gliders had been carrying three of anti tank guns which were now included in bridge s defences including men from gliders 1st parachute brigade had 295 men at bridge mitcham p 153 shortage of manpower was not their only problem their only support weapons were anti tank guns two 3 inch mortars and a vickers machine gun daybreak by 04 30 on 14 july 1st parachute battalion was in control of primosole bridge but fallschirmjager machine gun battalion were well dug in to south beyond them 140 men of 2nd parachute battalion had occupied three small hills and taken 500 italian prisoners d este p 363 in numbers both battalions had little more than company strength 3rd parachute battalion had suffered worst in scattered parachute drop and only a few of their men had arrived at bridge with no command structure they were attached to 1st parachute battalion to help defend bridge mitcham p 158 to north italian 372nd coastal battalion and 10th arditi regiment had been informed of parachute landings many of 372nd battalion had disappeared while arditi mounted first of a number of attacks on british positions without support of any heavy weapons they were easily fought off thumb fallschirmjager with mg 42 machine gun also at dawn first attack by fallschirmjager machine gun battalion to south began when they opened fire with their machine guns and mortars their first assault was against 2nd parachute battalion s positions and was unsuccessful however their next assault later in morning succeeded in capturing johnny ii second of small hills lieutenant colonel john frost in command of 2nd parachute battalion immediately counterattacked but his men were repulsed after sustaining a number of casualties at 09 00 a forward observation officer attached to 2nd parachute battalion managed to make radio contact with british cruiser hms newfoundland which then used its 6 inch guns to target fallschirmjager positions naval gunfire had desired effect causing germans some casualties and keeping them under cover from then on german resistance from south was restricted to harassing machine gun fire a grass fire they started did force 2nd parachute battalion to abandon johnny i and remnants of battalion now concentrated on johnny iii mitcham p 157 to north of bridge a german battle group of 350 men including 1st company 1st fallschirmjager signal battalion an anti aircraft battery and some anti tank guns was gathered under command of captain franz strangenberg strangenberg was in position to launch his first assault on bridge at 14 00 this first attack was driven off by british paratroopers for his second attempt strangenberg brought up three 88 mm anti aircraft guns in support this assault was more successful taking some prisoners and almost succeeded in reaching bridge it also secured a position for 88s to engage two pillboxes on north bank by 17 00 men of 1st parachute battalion were almost out of ammunition and were forced to withdraw to southern side of bridge german 88s were moved forward again and this time demolished pillboxes on south side running short of supplies and with his casualties mounting brigadier lathbury made decision to relinquish control of bridge to germans and parachute brigade moved back of 295 men who had been at bridge 115 had become casualties 16th parachute field ambulance main dressing station could not be moved or evacuated and remained behind in no man s land cole p 48 an italian officer entered station and informed medical staff they were now prisoners of war but since they were treating casualties from both sides they were allowed to remain and continue operating treatment of wounded continued all day and by 22 00 surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 british and 29 german or italian patients at 18 30 in darkness lathbury led remainder of his men to join 2nd parachute battalion quarrie p 77 by dawn 50th northumbrian infantry division had only managed to advance and were still from no 3 commando at melati bridge and from primosole bridge mitcham p 155 it was not until 17 00 that 5th battalion east yorkshire regiment part of 69th infantry brigade eventually reached malati bridge although by now commandos had been forced to withdraw d este p 360 bridge was quickly captured commandos had dismantled demolition charges so that it could not be demolished with their first objective secured british infantry continued their advance on foot towards parachute brigade tanks and small amount of motor transport belonging to 4th armoured brigade had been held up even further back they had been stopped in carlentini by a destroyed bridge and 4th armoured brigade did not start moving again until after 19 00 50th northumbrian division eventually reached lentini about halfway from their start point to primosole bridge in afternoon here streets were blocked by debris covered by snipers and machine gunners left as a rearguard by retreating germans mitcham p 156 by nightfall only one of 50th northumbrian division s infantry battalions 6th battalion durham light infantry of 151st infantry brigade with some tanks in support had reached a position from johnny ii despite their orders to advance at all speed they halted for night recapture of bridge after parachute brigade withdrew axis forces gathered at bridge they now comprised italian 372nd coastal battalion and arditi battalion with german 1st fallschirmjager machine gun battalion and captain s battle group german high command was aware of importance of holding bridge and overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute these came from 1st fallschirmjager division and consisted of 1st fallschirmjager engineer battalion 1st battalion 4th fallschirmjager regiment and a battalion of 1st fallschirmjager artillery regiment mitchum p 159 fallschirmjager engineers started to form a defensive line to north of bridge and a smaller one on southern bank thumb royal engineers repairing bridge after it was captured by british for second time early on 15 july 1st parachute brigade heard tank fire to south of their position brigadier lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate which located tanks and infantry of xiii corps that had halted just south of them previous night tugwell p 165 1st parachute brigade and 50th northumbrian division now moved forward together main dressing station which had continued to operate after being captured was liberated by 2nd parachute battalion in an attempt to recapture primosole bridge 9th battalion durham light infantry supported by 44th royal tank regiment carried out a number of assaults at one stage they managed to cross bridge but three sherman tanks accompanying them were knocked out by german 88s and with no armoured support infantry were forced to withdraw however an error in communication caused fallschirmjager engineer battalion to withdraw to north bank of river and this allowed to establish a position at southern end of bridge at main dressing station surgeons had operated on another 14 wounded by time ambulances arrived from xiii corps at 17 00 to evacuate wounded cole p 49 at 18 00 main dressing station was closed and men moved to johnny i during time main dressing station had been active surgeons had completed 31 operations and medics had treated 109 wounded cole p 50 germans were aware that british paratroopers had dismantled explosive charges attached to primosole bridge and now attempted to destroy it by driving trucks laden with explosives onto it this was unsuccessful d este p 392 during night 9th battalion durham light infantry continued trying to capture bridge their attacks also provided a distraction for germans while lieutenant colonel pearson of 1st parachute battalion led two companies of 8th battalion durham light infantry across simeto river using a small ford to establish another bridgehead on northern bank during day s battle both british and germans suffered heavy casualties but bridge was eventually retaken by british infantry leaving british eighth army to continue their advance at 07 00 16 july 1st parachute brigade were transported in trucks to syracuse where they embarked on a lst here they remained overnight sitting through a two hour air raid and sailed for valletta at 12 00 on 17 july in operation fustian they had suffered around 141 dead and 168 missing or wounded mitcham p 78 aftermath operation was successful in end though narrow in victory in part because of uncoordinated and ill controlled friendly anti aircraft fire only forty percent of 5 000 paratroopers dropped had landed near their assigned drop zones shrader p 69 recapture of primosole bridge did not result in rapid advance over catania plain envisioned by montgomery by now exhausted 50th northumbrian infantry division was holding a position based on bridge 5th infantry division took over lead but after a number of attacks could not make any further progress its 13th infantry brigade had to establish another bridgehead across simeto d este p 404 but germans had brought in more troops and prepared defensive positions and after hard fighting it was not until 5 august 1943 that eighth army entered city of catania itself further hard fighting followed and they entered messina just after united states seventh army on 17 august 1943 after an enquiry into problems with airborne missions in sicily british army and royal air force submitted some recommendations tugwell p 167 aircrew had to be trained in parachute and glider operations and pathfinders landing before main force had to have enough time to set out their beacons landing plan was simplified with complete brigades landing on one drop zone instead of smaller battalion landing areas used in sicily gliders were no longer released at night while still over water and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate aircraft with room to spare mrazek p 85 following friendly fire incident over convoy more training was given to ships crews in aircraft recognition and allied aircraft were painted with three large white stripes on their wings nigl p 68 training for pilots belonging to glider pilot regiment was increased and improvements to gliders were implemented including better inter aircraft communication nigl p 69 for transporting paratroops to avoid relying solely on american aircraft and pilots no 38 wing royal air force was expanded becoming no 38 group with its halifax squadrons now supported by four squadrons of albemarles and four squadrons of stirlings to provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery guns by air air force started experiments on parachuting them into combat carrying jeeps and guns in aircraft s large bomb bays lake p 81 a second royal air force transport group no 46 group was formed and was equipped solely with dakotas instead of mixture of aircraft in no 38 group tugwell p 202 after these changes royal air force groups could supply 88 albemarles 88 stirlings 36 halifaxes and 150 dakotas a total of 362 planes in addition to aircraft held as reserves lessons were learned from near disastrous parachute drops on sicily and paved way for larger and more successful operations in
