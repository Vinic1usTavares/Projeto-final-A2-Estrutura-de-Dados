murray cod maccullochella peelii is a large australian predatory freshwater fish of genus maccullochella in family dianne j bray vanessa j thompson 2011 murray cod maccullochella peelii fishes of australia retrieved 29 august 2014 although species is called a cod in vernacular it is not related to northern hemisphere marine cod species murray cod is an important part of australia s vertebrate wildlife as an apex predator in murray darling river system and also significant in australia s human culture murray cod is largest exclusively freshwater fish in australia and one of largest in world other common names for murray cod include cod mary river cod murray perch and queensland freshwater cod scientific name of murray cod derives from an early australian fish researcher with surname mcculloch and river from which explorer major mitchell first scientifically described species peel river this was for a number of years changed to m peelii peelii to differentiate murray cod from mary river cod which were designated as a subspecies of murray cod however as of 2010 mary river cod have been raised to full species status m mariensis thus murray cod have reverted simply to m peelii murray cod populations have declined severely since european colonisation of australia due to a number of causes including severe overfishing river regulation and habitat degradation and are now a listed threatened species however they once inhabited almost entire murray darling basin australia s largest river system in very great numbers a long lived fish adult murray cod are carnivorous and mainly eat other fish species exhibits a high degree of parental care for their eggs which are spawned in spring and are generally laid in hollow logs or on other hard surfaces murray cod are a popular angling target and aquaculture species often available through aquarium trade they are also a popular aquarium species in australia description thumb a murray cod displaying characteristic mottled green colouration fish was carefully released after photo murray cod is a large grouper like fish with a deep elongated body that is round in cross section it has a broad scooped head and a large mouth lined with pads of very small needle like teeth jaws of murray cod are equal or lower jaw protrudes slightly spiny dorsal fin of murray cod is moderate to low in height and is partially separated by a notch from high rounded soft dorsal fin soft dorsal anal and caudal tail fins are all large and rounded and are dusky grey or black with distinct white edges large rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in colour to flanks pelvic fins are large angular and set forward of pectoral fins leading white coloured rays on pelvic fins split into two trailing white filaments while pelvic fins themselves are usually a translucent white or cream tending toward opacity in large fish murray cod are white to cream on their ventral belly surfaces their backs and flanks are usually yellowish green to green overlain with heavy darker green but occasionally brown or black mottling effect is a marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard s markings colouration is related to water clarity colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats small to medium sized murray cod from clear water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration very large fish tend towards a speckled grey green colouration size murray cod are large fish with adult fish regularly reaching in length in all but very smallest waterways murray cod are capable of growing well over in length and largest on record was over and about in weight large breeding fish are rare in most wild populations today due to overfishing related species thumb left murray cod push significant distances into upland river habitats murray cod continue a pattern present in murray darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species murray cod are primarily lowland species and endangered trout cod are specialist upland species pattern is slightly blurred in cod species because being adaptable and successful fish murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats while now endangered trout cod stray or did stray before their decline well down upland lowland transition zone which can be extensive in murray darling rivers nevertheless basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present murray cod like a number of other murray darling native fish species have also managed to cross great dividing range at least once through natural river capture events leading to several species and subspecies of coastal cod best known are eastern freshwater cod of clarence river system in northern new south wales and mary river cod of mary river system in south eastern queensland both of which are endangered but survive today coastal cod were also found in richmond river system in northern new south wales and brisbane river system in southern queensland but are now extinct taxonomy in 1800s and early 1900s commercial fishermen recreational fishermen riverside residents and some fisheries scientists e g anderson stead langtry distinctly recognised two species of cod in southern murray darling basin murray cod and trout cod or blue nose cod taxonomically however confusion abounded ignoring glaring differences in size at sexual maturity and via some rather unscientific reasoning some prominent fisheries scientists e g whitley insisted on recognising only one species of cod murray cod then named maccullochella macquariensis after an early australian fish researcher with surname mcculloch and macquarie river in new south wales where holotype was captured then as trout cod declined into near extinction over 1900s distinction between two species was further eroded and finally questioned in 1970s early genetic techniques confirmed that trout cod were a separate species and further showed that original murray cod specimen was in fact a trout cod following rules of scientific classification name m macquariensis remained with original specimen now known to be trout cod and a new name m peelii for peel river where new holotype was captured was coined for murray cod subsequently two further cod were identified as separate species eastern freshwater cod m and mary river cod m mariensis range murray cod is named after murray river part of murray darling basin in eastern australia australia s largest and most important river system draining around 14 of continent murray cod s natural range encompasses virtually whole murray darling basin particularly lowland areas and extending well into upland areas to about elevation in southern half of basin and to about in northern half of basin thumb distribution of murray cod consequently murray cod inhabit a remarkably wide variety of habitats from cool clear fast flowing streams with riffle and pool structure and rocky substrates in upland areas to large slow flowing meandering rivers in extensive alluvial lowland reaches of murray darling basin thumb left a small murray cod from a run in an upland river murray cod have died out in many of their upland habitats particularly in southern murray darling basin due to a combination of overfishing siltation dams and weirs blocking migration pollution from arsenic based sheep dips mining and in some cases introduced trout stockings which causes competition between juvenile murray cod and introduced trout species age murray cod are very long lived which is characteristic of many freshwater native fish in australia longevity is a survival strategy in variable australian environment to ensure that most adults participate in at least one exceptional spawning and recruitment event which are often linked to unusually wet la nina years and may only occur every one or two decades murray cod are most long lived freshwater native fish in australia oldest murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age and even larger specimens of years past leave little doubt that species can reach considerably greater ages of 70 years or more diet murray cod is apex aquatic predator in rivers of murray darling basin and will eat almost anything smaller than itself and anything in its way including finned fishes such as smaller murray cod golden perch silver perch bony bream eel tailed catfish western carp gudgeon and australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp goldfish and english perch as well as crustaceans such as freshwater shrimp and murray crayfish fish compose majority of diet of mature murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats and that murray cod are apex predators in these habitats murray cod have also been known to eat ducks cormorants freshwater turtles water dragons snakes mice and frogs observations of recreational fishermen fishing for murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that popular description of murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct while this behaviour is typical during day at night murray cod are active pelagic predators venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from surface reproduction murray cod reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age generally five years sexual maturity in murray cod is dependent on age therefore roughly 70 of wild river murray cod with their slower growth rate have reached sexual maturity by in length wild murray cod in impoundments like lake with their faster growth rates do not reach sexual maturity until they are well over in length these data strongly indicate 60 cm 20 in size limit for murray cod is inadequate and should be increased substantially to allow for a greater chance of reproduction before capture large female murray cod in 15 to 35 kg 35 to 80 lb range are most important breeders because they produce most eggs and for other reasons large females in most fish species are also important because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours such large females may also have valuable successful genes to pass on all of these factors mean spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than spawnings of small female fish not surprisingly there is no truth to claim made by some recreational fishers that large murray cod don t breed female murray cod upon first reaching sexual maturity have egg counts of no more than 10 000 very large female murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80 000 90 000 although a recent very large 33 kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110 000 viable eggs egg counts in female murray cod of all sizes are relatively low compared to many fish species murray cod spawn in spring cued by rising water temperatures and increasing photoperiod daylight length initially fish biologists working with murray cod considered spring floods and temperatures of to be necessary and that spring flooding is critical for successful recruitment i e survival to juvenile stages of young cod by providing an influx of pelagic zooplankton and early life stage macroinvertebrates off flood plain into main river channel for first feeding but more recent research has shown murray cod breed annually with or without spring floods and at temperatures as low as additionally recent research has shown abundant epibenthic epiphytic bottom dwelling edge clinging prey in unflooded lowland rivers traits in murray cod larvae that should allow survival in a variety of challenging conditions and a significant proportion of murray cod larvae feeding successfully in unflooded rivers latest research has also shown that murray cod in fact live their entire lifecycle within main channel of stream earlier ideas that murray cod spawn on floodplains or larvae feed on floodplains are incorrect murray cod breed in main river channel or in times of spring flood inundated upper portion of main channel and tributary channels but not on floodplains murray cod larvae feed within main river channel or in times of spring flood on inundated upper portion of main channel and channel floodplain boundary but not on floodplain spawning is preceded by significant upstream migrations if high spring flows or floods allow radio tracked murray cod in murray river have migrated up to upstream to spawn before returning to exactly same snag from where they departed an unusual homing behaviour in a freshwater fish decades of observations by recreational and commercial fishermen suggest such spring spawning migrations are common across murray cod s geographical range spawning is initiated by pairing up and courtship rituals during courtship ritual a spawning site is selected and cleaned hard surfaces such as rocks in upland rivers and impoundments and logs and occasionally clay banks in lowland rivers at a depth of are selected female lays large adhesive eggs as a mat on spawning surface which male fertilises female then leaves spawning site male remains to guard eggs during incubation which takes six to 10 days depending on water temperature and to guard hatched larvae for a further week or so until they disperse larvae disperse from nest site by drifting in river currents at night and continue this behaviour around four to seven days during this dispersal process larvae simultaneously absorb remainder of their yolk sac and begin to feed on pelagic zooplankton small early life stage macroinvertebrates and epibenthic epiphytic bottom dwelling edge clinging it may be that murray cod are first freshwater fish identified as having long term pair bonding in its repertoire of mating strategies in wild relationship between river flows and murray cod recruitment are more complex than first thought and in less regulated rivers murray cod may be able to recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows significant recruitment of murray cod in low flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven this information also suggests that regulation related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in survival and recruitment of murray cod larvae than first thought competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting survival and recruitment of murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in current state of murray cod stocks through depletion of spawning adults than first thought these findings do not mean that river regulation and water extraction have not had adverse effects on fish stocks rather river regulation has been a major factor in decline of murray cod and other native fish thermal pollution is also a major problem evidence indicates strong murray cod recruitment events which may be important for sustaining murray cod populations over long term can result from spring flooding and health of australian lowland river ecosystems generally rely on periodic spring flooding also due to regulation of most of rivers in murray darling river system mainly for irrigation purposes only exceptional spring floods manage to break free long term viability of wild murray cod other native fish species and river ecosystems in face of this fact are of great concern conservation murray cod were originally most common large native fish in murray darling basin contrary to some fishery department literature first serious declines in murray cod were caused by extremely severe overfishing in latter half of 1800s and early 1900s murray cod very large very long lived fish were caught in unimaginable numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen for example one commercial fishing operation commenced on murray river near echuca in 1855 targeting murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river and yet within eight years grave concerns over sustainability of this operation and complaints about near absence of murray cod in their heavily fished grounds were being raised in main state newspaper argus yet fishing effort continued to increase in region so in late 1880s and early 1890s between 40 000 and 150 000 kg of mostly murray cod between 7 500 and 27 000 fish at an average weight of 5 5 kg were caught near echuca similarly in 1883 more than 147 000 kg of murray cod were sent to melbourne from just one river town by 1920s murray cod had been overfished to point where large scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era using rods and reels handlines setlines drum nets gill nets and even explosives with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild murray cod stocks is best summarised by a short article in register news a south australian newspaper in 1929 in last 29 years 26 214 502 lbs nearly 11 703 tons 11 915 683 kg of murray cod has been eaten by people of melbourne superintendent of markets mr g b minns included these figures in a statement he made today pointing out that supply was declining in 1918 peak year was received at market but since 1921 when was sent to melbourne supply has decreased last year 1928 it was only incredibly 20 years later aquatic ecologist j o langtry was still compelled to criticise extremely heavy lawless fishing pressure in form of both uncontrolled small scale commercial fishing and rampant illegal fishing with which he was confronted in all reaches of murray river he investigated in 1949 1950 indeed a thorough reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports reveals that whole history of wild murray cod between mid 1800s and mid 1900s was one of citizen agitation government inaction and ongoing stock decline for decade after decade riverside residents commercial fishermen recreational fishermen local fisheries inspectors fish retailers and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about evidently continuously declining murray cod stocks to be met in turn either with government denials or conversely with various ineffective inquiries into murray cod stocks and fisheries and various ineffective control measures for decade after decade debate about excessive fishing pressure number of fishermen number of nets net mesh size bag limits minimum size limits and take of small cod closed seasons and taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring and other sundry issues raged on and on without proper resolution with fishing regulations either not amended or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored and with heavy commercial recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated end result was a murray cod population initially unimaginably abundant continually fished down and down and down without pause until in early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation listed below emerged to drive species even further into decline all of these drivers of decline have left this iconic australian fish in a perilous situation there are now grave concerns for long term survival of wild murray cod populations victorian department of sustainability and environment 2004 newsletter number 25 retrieved 28 september 2007 thumb an example of extreme severe overfishing of murray cod in late 1800s which cause first strong declines in species such catches were typical for period although angler effects are sometimes disregarded in overall picture today recent population studies have shown that while all year classes are well represented up to minimum legal angling size now 60 centimetres in most states above that size numbers of fish are dramatically reduced almost to point of non existence in many waters some emphasis has been made of results of two small surveys which suggested a majority of murray cod are released by anglers however there are valid questions as to representativeness of these surveys these surveys do not explain dramatic disappearance of large numbers of young murray cod at exactly minimum size limit and most importantly any emphasis on these surveys miss fundamental point as a large long lived species with relatively low fecundity and delayed sexual maturity wild murray cod populations are extremely vulnerable to overfishing even with only modest angler kill a tightening of fishing regulations for wild murray cod as referred to above and a switch by fishermen to a largely catch and release approach for wild murray cod would alleviate this problem recognising these issues in late 2014 new south wales and victorian fishery departments amended their regulations so that a slot limit of 55 to 75 cm now applies in these states i e only murray cod between 55 and 75 cm may be taken those above and below this size range or slot must be released this measure should have positive effects for murray cod population by protecting and increasing proportion of large breeding murray cod another issue is that murray cod caught and released in winter while developing their eggs or in spring prior to spawning their eggs and do not spawn this may be a minor issue compared to some of other threats facing murray cod nevertheless concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild murray cod at these times at this point in time a closed season is in place for spring spawning period during which anglers are not allowed to target murray cod even on a catch and release basis state government fisheries departments support murray cod populations by stocking with hatchery bred fish especially in man made lakes important issues affecting restoration of cod populations such as need for spring floods and excessive angler take are slowly being acknowledged but are yet to be definitely addressed other concerns such as stocking of murray cod in areas where trout cod m are recovering encourages hybridisation and needs consideration for future restocking programs effects of river regulation murray river and southern tributaries originally displayed a pattern of high flows in winter high flows and floods in spring and low flows in summer and autumn breeding of murray cod and other murray darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns river regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns with negative effects on breeding and recruitment of murray cod murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in winter and spring small and medium floods including once annual spring flood pulse have been completely eliminated it is estimated that flows at river mouth by 1995 had declined to only 27 of natural outflows murray darling basin commission water audit report 2004 2005 retrieved 28 september 2007 probability of bottom end of murray experiencing drought like flows had increased from 5 under natural conditions to 60 by 1995 thermal pollution is artificial reduction in water temperatures especially in summer and autumn caused when frigid water is released from bottom of reservoirs for irrigation demands such temperature suppression typically extends several hundred kilometres downstream thermal pollution inhibits both breeding of murray cod and survival of murray cod larvae and in extreme cases inhibits even survival of adult murray cod rare floods that do break free of dams and weirs of murray darling system have their magnitude and duration deliberately curtailed by river regulators increasing research indicates this management practice is very harmful and drastically reduces general ecosystem benefits and breeding and recruitment opportunities for murray cod and other murray darling native fish species these now rare floods can provide blackwater events blackwater events are emerging as a very serious threat to wild murray cod stocks in lowland river reaches blackwater events occur when floodplains and ephemeral channels accumulate large quantities of leaf litter over a number of years and are then finally inundated in a flood event leaf litter releases large quantities of dissolved organic carbon turning water a characteristic black colour and inducing a temporary explosion in bacterial numbers and activity which in turn consume dissolved oxygen reducing them to levels harmful or fatal to fish fish essentially asphyxiate water temperature is a critical regulator of blackwater events as warmer water temperatures increase bacterial activity and markedly reduce intrinsic oxygen carrying capacity of water events that may be tolerable for fish in winter or early spring may be catastrophic in late spring or summer due to increase in water temperature blackwater events are often described as natural events while there are some historical records of relatively severe events in smaller more ephemeral systems e g lower lachlan upper darling there is no record of severe events in murray river and its largest southern tributaries before water extraction and river regulation in murray and large southern tributaries very severe large scale blackwater events are a relatively new but recurring phenomenon and appear to be an effect of river regulation curtailing winter spring flood events that formerly swept leaf litter away annually exacerbated by long term declines in rainfall and recurring prolonged drought events flood events in 2010 and 2012 following prolonged millennium drought 1997 2009 induced very severe blackwater events while formal studies of these events were limited due to relatively rapid response times required and logistical difficulties angler photographs and observations of extraordinary numbers of dead murray cod during these events and plunging catch rates after these events show they induced extremely heavy murray cod mortalities along extensive tracts of murray river physical barriers to fish movement dams weirs and other barriers block migration of adult and juvenile murray cod and prevent recolonisation of habitats and maintenance of isolated populations additionally recent study has proven approximately 50 of murray cod larvae are killed when they pass through undershot weirs habitat degradation siltation hundreds of thousands perhaps more than a million submerged timber snags mainly river red gum have been removed from lowland reaches of murray darling basin over past 150 years removal of such a vast number of snags has had devastating impacts on murray cod and river ecosystems snags are critical habitats and spawning sites for murray cod snags are also critical for functioning of lowland river ecosystems as one of few hard substrates in lowland river channels composed of fine silts snags are crucial sites for biofilm growth macroinvertebrate grazing and general in stream productivity vegetation clearing and cattle trampling river banks create severe siltation which fill in pools degrade river ecosystems and make rivers and streams uninhabitable for murray cod this is exacerbated by removal of riparian riverbank vegetation which causes siltation and degrades river ecosystems in many ways overfishing while extremely severe commercial and recreational overfishing in 1800s and early 1900s caused first strong declines of murray cod overfishing by recreational fishermen aided by inadequate fishing regulations continues today and remains an extremely serious threat to murray cod current size limit of 60 centimetres in most states is inadequate now that scientific studies have documented average size at sexual maturity in murray cod this and catch data and computer modelling exercises on wild murray cod stocks indicate measures such as raising size limit to 70 centimetres and reducing bag and possession limits from 2 and 4 fish respectively to 1 fish are urgently needed to maintain long term viability of wild murray cod populations as of november 2014 nsw department of fisheries has introduced a maximum size limit of 75 cm for murray cod to provide protection for large breeding fish as well as a new minimum size limit of 55 cm introduced carp evidence is mounting that there is serious competition for food between larval early juvenile introduced carp and larval early juvenile native fish introduced carp dominate fish faunas of lowland murray darling rivers sheer amount of biomass carp now take up and large numbers of larvae carp produce causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish carp are main vector of introduced lernaea parasite lernaea and
