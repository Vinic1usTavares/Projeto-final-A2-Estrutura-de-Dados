right thumb upright satellite image of northern britain and ireland showing approximate area of dal riata shaded aedan mac gabrain pronounced in old irish was a king of dal riata from c 574 until c 609 kingdom of dal riata was situated in modern argyll and bute scotland and parts of county antrim ireland genealogies record that aedan was a son of gabran mac domangairt he was a contemporary of saint columba and much that is recorded of his life and career comes from hagiography such as adomnan of iona s life of saint columba aedan appears as a character in old irish and middle irish language works of prose and verse some now lost irish annals record aedan s campaigns against his neighbours in ireland and in northern britain including expeditions to orkney islands isle of man and east coast of scotland as recorded by bede aedan was decisively defeated by aethelfrith of bernicia at battle of degsastan aedan may have been deposed or have abdicated following this defeat his date of death is recorded by one source as 17 april 609 sources sources for aedan s life include bede s historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum irish annals principally annals of ulster and annals of tigernach and adomnan s life of saint columba senchus fer n alban a census and genealogy of dal riata purports to record his ancestry and that of his immediate descendants none of these sources are contemporary adomnan s work was written in very late 7th century probably to mark centenary of columba s death it incorporates elements from a lost earlier life of columba de sancti columbae by cummene find this may have been written as early as 640 neither elements incorporated from cummene s work nor adomnan s own writings can be treated as simple history bede s history was written 30 years after adomnan s surviving irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at iona from middle of 7th century onwards so that these too are retrospective when dealing with aedan s time hughes bannerman fraser rawlinson b 502 manuscript dated to c 1130 contains tale gein branduib maic echach ocus aedain maic gabrain birth of brandub son of and of aedan son of gabran in this story aedan is twin brother of brandub mac echach a king of leinster who belonged to ui kindred aedan is exchanged at birth for one of twin daughters of gabran born same night so that each family might have a son prophecy of berchan also associates aedan with leinster john bannerman concluded that t here seems to be no basis of fact behind these traditions bannerman pp 89 90 francis john byrne suggested that echtra was written by a poet at court of diarmait mac mail na mbo an 11th century descendant of brandub and was written to cement an alliance between diarmait and scots king mael coluim mac donnchada

welsh sources making him one of few non britons to figure in welsh tradition bromwich p 272 welsh sources call him aedan meaning treacherous or wily he may have earned this epithet after collapse of an alliance with rhydderch hael king of nearby brittonic kingdom of alt clut enmity between them is remembered in welsh triads and elsewhere bromwich p 272 494 another triad records aedan s host as one of three faithful war bands of island of britain as they went to sea for their lord bromwich pp 62 65 jones p 39 though this triad like bonedd gwyr y gogledd flips father and son s names as gauran map aedan bromwich p 64 takes it as a reference to aedan rather than his father this may point to an otherwise lost tradition concerning one of aedan s sea expeditions such as to orkney or isle of man bromwich p 64 273 additionally several welsh works claim a brittonic pedigree for aedan bonedd gwyr y gogledd records him as a descendant of dyfnwal hen of alt clut though genealogy is much confused gauran is given as his son rather than father bromwich pp 256 257 latin de situ and brychan claim his mother was luan daughter of brychan of brycheiniog in wales though these pedigrees are inconsistent and likely dubious they are notable in highlighting aedan s close association with britons bromwich pp 272 273 neighbours aedan was chief king in dal riata ruling over lesser tribal kings senchus fer n alban records sub divisions of dal riata in 7th and 8th centuries but no record from aedan s time survives according to senchus dal riata was divided into three sub kingdoms in 7th century each ruled by a kin group named for their eponymous founder these were cenel ngabrain named for aedan s father who ruled over kintyre cowal and bute cenel loairn of northern argyll and cenel of islay within these there were smaller divisions or tribes which are named by senchus bannerman pp 47 49 and 108 118 charles edwards pp 296 297 details of irish part of kingdom are less clear looking outward dal riata s neighbours in north britain were picts and britons of hen ogledd brittonic speaking parts of what is now northern england and southern lowland scotland most powerful

northern britain can be found in for example yorke pp 33 97 in ireland dal riata formed part of ulster ruled by baetan mac cairill of dal fiatach other major grouping in ulster were disunited tribes of cruithne later known as dal naraidi most important cruithne king in aedan s time was fiachnae mac baetain beyond kingdom of ulster and generally hostile to it were various kingdoms and tribes of ui

years later than 575 adomnan reports that aedan was present at meeting adomnan i 48 purpose of meeting is not entirely certain but one agreement made there concerned status of aedan s kingdom aedan

anderson pp 148 149 bannerman pp 1 2 byrne irish kings p 110 reason for this agreement is thought to have been threat posed to aedan and also to aed by baetan mac cairill baetan is said to have forced

diadem only recorded battle between aedan and picts appears to have been fought in circinn in 599 or after where aedan was defeated annals mention deaths of his sons here bannerman pp 84 86 it has been suggested that this battle was confused with battle of asreth in circinn fought c 584 in which bridei son of maelchon was killed this battle is described as being fought between picts themselves battle of asreth is apparently misdated appearing under 752 in annals of tigernach see m o anderson pp 30 31 36 37 a number of welsh traditions point to warfare between aedan and king rhydderch hael of alt clut northern brittonic kingdom later known as strathclyde hector munro chadwick and subsequent historians suggest aedan was initially in a long term alliance with rhydderch and his predecessors but that it eventually collapsed into conflict adomnan reports that rhydderch sent a monk named to iona to speak with columba for he wanted to learn whether he would be slaughtered by his enemies or not a welsh triad names aedan s plundering of alt clut as one of three unrestrained of britain and poem tells of a battle between aedan and rhydderch adomnan i 15 and translator s note 89 bannerman pp 88 89 lost irish epic orgain is usually thought to refer to attack on alt clut in 870 by vikings but macquarrie suggests that it may refer to an attack by aedan on rhydderch macquarrie p 109 degsastan and after degsastan appears not to have been first battle between aedan and bernicians death of his son domangart in land of saxons is mentioned by adomnan and it is presumed that bran died in same otherwise unrecorded battle adomnan i 9 bannerman pp 85 and 91 92 of roots of this conflict bede mentions only that aedan was alarmed by aethelfrith s advance wherever battle of degsastan was fought bede saw it as lying within northumbria battle was a decisive victory for aethelfrith and bede says carefully that f rom that day until present no king of irish in britain has dared to do battle with english although victorious aethelfrith suffered losses bede tells us his brother theodbald was killed with all his following theodbald appears to be called in irish sources which name his killer as mael mac baetain of cenel neogain son of high king baetan mac irish poem compert mongain says that king of ulster fiachnae mac baetain of dal naraidi aided aedan against saxons perhaps at degsastan anglo saxon chronicle mentions that hering son of king of bernicia was present apparently fighting with aedan bede i 34 bannerman pp 86 88 byrne irish kings p 111 kirby pp 70 72 macquarrie pp 103 104 notes some textual inconsistencies in irish sources and suggests that battle of saxons recorded in irish annals may not be bede s battle of degsastan after defeat of degsastan annals report

caledonia to pictland p 141 prophecy of berchan places his death in kintyre and says h e will not be king at time of his death while 12th century acta sancti claims that he was expelled from kingship john of fordun writing in 14th century believed that aedan had been buried at in kintyre bannerman pp 80 81 and 86 87 aedan s descendants aedan was succeeded by his son eochaid buide adomnan gives an account of columba s prophecy that eochaid s older brothers would predecease their father adomnan i 9 aedan s other sons are named by senchus fer n alban as eochaid find bran conaing and gartnait name conaing implies a familiarity with anglo saxons and their language as it is derived from old english king byrne irish kings pp 111 112 appearance of two sons named eochaid is not an error as noted by charles edwards p 6 adomnan also names artur called a son of conaing in senchus and domangart who is not included in senchus domangart too may have been a grandson rather than a son of aedan most likely another son of conaing main line of cenel ngabrain kings were descendants of eochaid buide through his son domnall brecc but descendants of conaing successfully contested for throne throughout 7th century and into 8th adomnan i 9 anderson essh pp 95 96 bannerman pp 47 49 90 96 and 103 it has been suggested that gartnait son of aedan could be same person as gartnait son of domelch king of picts whose death is reported around 601 but this rests on idea of pictish matriliny which has been criticised even less certainly it has been argued that gartnait s successor in pictish king lists nechtan was his grandson and thus aedan s great grandson anderson essh pp 121 123 and 145 bannerman pp 93 94 smyth p 70 on pictish matriliny in general see woolf that pictish king nechtan and nechtan son of cano are same person is questionable see m o anderson pp 116 154 macquarrie pp 167 170 less is known of aedan s daughters also recorded as gemma married a prince named of dal fiatach names of aedan s wives are not recorded but one was said to be brittonic and another may have been a pictish woman named domelch if indeed gartnait son of domelch and gartnait son of aedan are one and same
