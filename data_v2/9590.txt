persuaded reluctant physicians to allow him to meet and counsel aids patients at conant s ks clinic people with aids movement in 1982 campbell and turner convened a meeting that spawned people with aids san francisco founding people with aids self empowerment movement or pwa movement rapidly followed by michael callen and richard berkowitz authors of how to have sex in an epidemic in new york city as well as arguing that people with aids should expect to participate actively in response to aids crisis pwa movement rejected terms aids victim and aids patient as campbell explained in interviews for example with other members of people with aids san francisco campbell organized first candlelight march to bring attention to plight of people with aids and to remember those who had died of aids on may 2 1983 they marched behind a banner of fighting for our lives for first time drawing around 10 000 people on may 23 1983 people with aids san francisco voted to send campbell and turner to fifth national lesbian and gay health conference at which second national aids forum would be held campbell and his colleagues push to persuade service organizations to sponsor gay men with aids to attend conference was a key moment in people with aids self empowerment movement michael callen subsequently wrote that despite a growing sense of being patronised it had not occurred to aids diagnosed new yorkers to be anything more than passive recipients of genuine care and concern once people with aids realised they could advocate for themselves lessons learned from feminist and civil rights movement helped with a more widespread acceptance of notion of self empowerment national pwa movement came fully together when campbell took charge of a discussion where with callen turner and others those in attendance included from san francisco bobbi campbell dan turner 1948 90 bobby reynolds died 1987 and michael helquist representing his recently deceased partner mark feldman from new york city phil died 1986 michael callen 1955 93 richard berkowitz artie felson bill burke bob cecchi 1942 91 matthew sarner m s w tom nasrallah from los angeles gar traynor plus someone named elbert from kansas city by way of houston and one individual from denver whose name we unfortunately cannot recall see remembering bobbi campbell from daily and a history of pwa self empowerment movement by callen and turner he drafted denver principles defining manifesto of pwa movement which again start with rejection of terms victim and patient campbell and san franciscans had different thoughts on origin etiology of aids from callen and new yorkers campbell described as crazy idea that aids was caused by promiscuity a perspective espoused by callen and berkowitz and their physician joseph sonnabend at time linked from and denver principles represent a careful synthesis of these two positions as joe wright explained in footnote 63 to his 2013 article in american journal of public health for example recommendations for all people would have been easy points of agreement last of recommendations for people with aids on sexual ethics underlines their agreements about safe sex but without delving into language of promiscuity or its rebuttals and second recommendation for health care providers appears to be a gentle assertion of callen s concerns about etiology while third likely reflects campbell s own approach to how to be a clinician and would have been sort of instruction a progressive nursing educator might have given at time activists in an echo of lavender menace radical feminists storming now convention stage in 1970 decided to storm stage of closing session of second national aids forum in order to present denver principles as each of 11 men read out one of 11 statements they did so with fighting for our lives banner behind them from san francisco march earlier that month these words became slogan of pwa movement after conference campbell flew to new
