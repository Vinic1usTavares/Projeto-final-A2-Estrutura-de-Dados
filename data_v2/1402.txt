sepinwall who reviewed episode for hitfix called it a great beginning funny in spots scary in others never blinking away from cruelty of this world and this war andy greenwald of grantland praised episode for its new additions of dillane and van houten its setup of later episodes and its themes it s also evident that second year of thrones if not remainder of series is about a race to fill what
