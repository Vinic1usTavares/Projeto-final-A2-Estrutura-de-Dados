hd 209458 b also given nickname osiris is an exoplanet that orbits solar analog hd 209458 in constellation pegasus some 159 light years from solar system radius of planet s orbit is 7 million kilometres about 0 047 astronomical units or one eighth radius of mercury s orbit this small radius results in a year that is 3 5 earth days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1 000 degc about 1 800 degf its mass is 220 times that of earth 0 69 jupiter masses and its volume is some 2 5 times greater than that of jupiter high mass and volume of hd 209458 b indicate that it is a gas giant hd 209458 b represents a number of milestones in extraplanetary research it was first of many categories a transiting extrasolar planet first planet detected through more than one method an extrasolar planet known to have an atmosphere an extrasolar planet observed to have an evaporating hydrogen atmosphere an extrasolar planet found to have an atmosphere containing oxygen and carbon one of first two extrasolar planets to be directly observed spectroscopically first extrasolar gas giant to have its superstorm measured first planet to have its orbital speed measured determining its mass directly based on application of new theoretical models as of april 2007 it is thought to be first extrasolar planet found to have water vapor in its atmosphere water found in extrasolar planet s atmosphere space of water seen on planet outside solar system by will dunham reuters tue apr 10 2007 8 edt in july 2014 nasa announced finding very dry atmospheres on hd 209458 b and two other exoplanets hd 189733 b and wasp 12b orbiting sun like stars detection and discovery transits spectroscopic studies first revealed presence of a planet around hd 209458 on november 5 1999 astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets in hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by transit of planet across star s face this would require planet s orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between earth and star and previously no transits had been detected soon after discovery separate teams one led by david charbonneau including timothy brown and others and other by gregory w henry were able to detect a transit of planet across surface of star making it first known transiting extrasolar planet on september 9 and 16 1999 charbonneau s team measured a 1 7 drop in hd 209458 s brightness which was attributed to passage of planet across star on november 8 henry s team observed a partial transit seeing only ingress henry et al hd 209458 sax 3 3138 12 november 1999 reported a transit ingress on nov 8 david charbonneau et al detection of planetary transits across a sun like star november 19 reports full transit observations on september 9 and 16 initially unsure of their results henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in september papers from both teams were published simultaneously in same issue of astrophysical journal each transit lasts about three hours during which planet covers about 1 5 of star s face star had been observed many times by hipparcos satellite which allowed astronomers to calculate orbital period of hd 209458 b very accurately at 3 days spectroscopic spectroscopic analysis had shown that planet had a mass about 0 69 times that of jupiter notes for star hd 209458 occurrence of transits allowed astronomers to calculate planet s radius which had not been possible for any previously known exoplanet and it turned out to have a radius some 35 larger than jupiter s direct detection on march 22 2005 nasa released news that infrared light from planet had been measured by spitzer space telescope first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet this was done by subtracting parent star s constant light and noting difference as planet transited in front of star and was eclipsed behind it providing a measure of light from planet itself new measurements from this observation determined planet s temperature as at least 750 degc 1300 degf circular orbit of hd 209458 b was also confirmed thumb 300px right transit of hd 209458 b spectral observation on february 21 2007 nasa and nature released news that hd 209458 b was one of first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed other one being hd 189733 b nasa s spitzer first to crack open light of faraway worlds this was long seen as first mechanism by which extrasolar but non sentient life forms could be searched for by way of influence on a planet s atmosphere a group of investigators led by jeremy richardson of nasa s goddard space flight center spectrally measured hd 209458 b s atmosphere in range of 7 5 to 13 2 micrometres results defied theoretical expectations in several ways spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10 micrometres which would have indicated water vapor in atmosphere but such a peak was absent indicating no detectable water vapor another unpredicted peak was observed at 9 65 micrometres which investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust a phenomenon not previously observed another unpredicted peak occurred at 7 78 micrometres for which investigators did not have an explanation a separate team led by mark swain of jet propulsion laboratory reanalyzed richardson et al data and had not yet published their results when richardson et al article came out but made similar findings on 23 june 2010 astronomers announced they have measured a superstorm with windspeeds of up to 7000 km h for first time in atmosphere of hd 209458 b very high precision observations done by eso s very large telescope and its powerful spectrograph of carbon monoxide gas show that it is streaming at enormous speed from extremely hot day side to cooler night side of planet observations also allow another exciting first measuring orbital speed of exoplanet itself providing a direct determination of its mass rotation as of august 2008 most recent calculation of hd 209458 b s rossiter mclaughlin effect and hence spin orbit angle is 4 4 1 4deg physical characteristics it had been previously hypothesized that hot jupiters particularly close to their parent star should exhibit this kind of inflation due to intense heating of their outer atmosphere tidal heating due to its orbit s eccentricity which may have been more eccentric at formation may also have played a role over past billion years stratosphere and upper clouds atmosphere is at a pressure of one bar at an altitude of 1 29 jupiter radii above planet s center where pressure is 33 5 millibars atmosphere is clear probably hydrogen and its rayleigh effect is detectable at that pressure temperature is 2200 260 k observations by orbiting and oscillations of stars telescope initially limited planet s albedo or reflectivity below 0 3 making it a surprisingly dark object geometric albedo has since been measured to be 0 038 0 045 in comparison jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0 52 this would suggest that hd 209458 b s upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is jupiter s or else has no clouds and rayleigh scatters incoming radiation like earth s dark ocean ref name albedo matthews j 2005 http www astro ca pr matthews html most space telescope plays hide seek with an exoplanet learns about atmosphere and weather of a distant world ref models since then have shown that between top of its atmosphere and hot high pressure gas surrounding mantle there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas this implies an outer shell of dark opaque hot cloud usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet a 2016 study indicates high altitude cloud cover is patchy with about 57 per cent coverage rayleigh scattering heated hydrogen rests at top of stratosphere absorptive portion of cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars exosphere surrounding that level on november 27 2001 hubble space telescope detected sodium first planetary atmosphere outside solar system to be measured this detection was predicted by sara seager in late 2001 core of sodium line runs from pressures of 50 millibar to a microbar this turns out to be about a third amount of sodium at hd 189733 b in 2003 4 astronomers used hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph to discover an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen carbon and oxygen around planet that reaches 10 000 k hydrogen exosphere extends to a distance rh 3 1 r j much larger than planetary radius of 1 32 rj at this temperature and distance maxwell boltzmann distribution of particle velocities gives rise to a significant tail of atoms moving at speeds greater than escape velocity planet is estimated to be losing about 100 500 million 1 5x108 kg of hydrogen per second analysis of starlight passing through envelope shows that heavier carbon and oxygen atoms are being blown from planet by extreme hydrodynamic drag created by its evaporating hydrogen atmosphere hydrogen tail streaming from planet is approximately 200 000 kilometres long which is roughly equivalent to its diameter it is thought that this type of atmosphere loss may be common to all planets orbiting sun like stars closer than around 0 1 au hd 209458 b will not evaporate entirely although it may have lost up to about 7 of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years it may be possible that planet s magnetic field may prevent this loss because exosphere would become ionized by star and magnetic field would contain ions from loss presumed atmospheric water vapor on april 10 2007 travis barman of lowell observatory announced evidence that atmosphere of hd 209458 b contained water vapor using a combination of previously published hubble space telescope measurements and new theoretical models barman found strong evidence for water absorption in planet s atmosphere first sign of water found on an alien world space 10 april 2007 new scientist space his method modeled light passing directly through atmosphere from planet s star as planet passed in front of it however this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation barman drew on data and measurements taken by heather knutson a student at harvard university from hubble space telescope and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate likelihood of water absorption in atmosphere of planet planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days and each time it passes in front of its parent star atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how atmosphere absorbs light passing from star directly through atmosphere in direction of earth according to a summary of research atmospheric water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of infrared spectrum compared to wavelengths in visible spectrum barman took knutson s hubble data on hd 209458 b applied to his theoretical model and allegedly identified water absorption in planet s atmosphere on april 24 astronomer david charbonneau who led team that made hubble observations cautioned that telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused theoretical model to suggest presence of water he hoped that further observations would clear matter up in following months as of april 2007 further investigation is being conducted on october 20 2009 researchers at jpl announced discovery of water vapor carbon dioxide and methane in atmosphere magnetic field in 2014 a magnetic field around hd 209458 b was inferred from way hydrogen was evaporating from planet it is first indirect detection of a magnetic field on an
