1970 atlantic hurricane season was first season of most recent low activity era cold phase of tropical cyclone formation in atlantic it was also first year in which reconnaissance aircraft flew into all four quadrants of a tropical cyclone season officially began on june 1 and lasted until november 30 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin season was fairly average with 10 total storms forming of which five were hurricanes two of those five became major hurricanes which are category 3 or higher on saffir simpson scale first system hurricane alma developed on may 17 storm killed eight people seven from flooding in cuba and one from a lightning strike in florida in july tropical storm becky brought minor flooding to florida and other parts of southern united states leaving one death and about 500 000 1970 usd in damage most significant storm of season was hurricane celia a category 3 hurricane that slammed south texas in early august celia resulted in about 930 million in damage and was costliest hurricane in texas until alicia in 1983 there were 28 fatalities with four in cuba eight in florida and sixteen in texas later that month tropical storm dorothy caused severe flooding in martinique which left up to 51 deaths and 34 million in damage one death occurred in mexico as a result of hurricane ella after a house collapsed in october tropical depression fifteen brought a devastating flood to puerto rico at least 22 fatalities and 65 5 million in damage occurred collectively storms of this season left at least 1 03 billion in damage and 115 deaths toc season summary thumb right rainfall from tropical depression nineteen in puerto rico atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 though activity began slightly earlier with hurricane alma forming on may 17 although 23 tropical depressions developed only ten of them reached tropical storm intensity this was comparable to 1950 2000 average of 9 6 named storms per season five of these reached hurricane status slightly under 1950 2000 average of 5 9 furthermore two storms reached major hurricane status near average 1950 2000 average of 2 3 collectively cyclones of this season caused at least 115 deaths and over 1 03 billion in damage atlantic hurricane season officially ended on november 30 though final tropical cyclone became extratropical on october 28 tropical cyclogenesis began in may with alma developing on may 17 no tropical cyclone activity occurred in june three systems originated in july including tropical storm becky and depression that would eventually intensify into hurricane celia as well as another tropical depression that remained below tropical storm intensity celia became most intense tropical cyclone of season on august 3 peaking as a category 3 hurricane on saffir simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of in august four tropical systems developed including an unnamed tropical storm dorothy and three other tropical depressions september eight featured tropical depressions though only three became named storms ella felice and greta october featured two unnamed hurricanes second of which became an extratropical cyclone on october 28 ending season s activity season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 40 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding which is tropical storm strength systems hurricane alma an area of disturbed weather persisted over southwestern caribbean in middle of may it gradually organized and a tropical depression formed on may 17 in response to low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures depression rapidly strengthened to a tropical storm early on may 20 and to a hurricane that night however increasing upper level wind shear caused alma to deteriorate back into a tropical depression tropical depression on may 22 depression continued its general northward movement with a brief jog to west and struck cuba on may 24 with maximum winds of as alma crossed eastern gulf of mexico it retained a well defined circulation with an eye feature evident on weather radar but persistent shear limited system s intensity tropical depression alma made landfall near cedar key florida on may 25 and became extratropical two days later over north carolina although alma passed just offshore impact in central america if any is unknown in cayman islands winds of 65 mph 105 km h were reported impact was most severe in cuba where flash flooding caused seven fatalities destroyed several homes forced evacuation of 3 000 people in oriente province and forced 16 sugar mills to suspend operations storm brought light rainfall to florida though precipitation peaked at near miami thunderstorms caused one death in miami and damaged some buildings in fort myers in other states impact came mostly in form of rain though a tornado near columbia south carolina unroofed one building tropical storm becky a large disturbance began to detach from intertropical convergence zone near panama on july 16 by july 19 disturbance developed into a tropical depression after tracking through yucatan channel depression became tropical storm becky on july 20 becky tracked northward to north northeastward across gulf of mexico and eventually strengthened to reach peak winds of 65 mph 100 km h late on july 20 thereafter upper level winds began weakening storm by july 22 becky made landfall near port st joe florida as a tropical depression storm weakened further over land eventually dissipating over western kentucky on july 23 throughout florida becky produced mostly light rainfall and gale force winds however in tallahassee storm dropped more than of rain which caused flooding in and around city according to red cross 104 families in tallahassee region suffered flood related losses additionally two injuries were reported some houses near tallahassee were flooded with of water resulting in evacuation of 15 households by rowboat more than 100 cars in area were also submerged in nearby wakulla county knee deep waters were reported at county courthouse in crawfordville a tornado spawned near panacea destroyed a house and damaged two others light to moderate rain fell in neighboring states and a tornado in georgia caused one fatality and destroyed two homes hurricane celia a tropical wave emerged into atlantic ocean from west coast of africa on july 23 it moved rapidly westward and reached western caribbean sea by july 30 on following day system developed into a tropical depression near grand cayman depression tracked north northwestward without significantly strengthening and struck crossed western cuba on august 1 depression entered gulf of mexico and was upgraded to tropical storm celia later on august 1 due to warm sea surface temperatures celia rapidly intensified into a category 3 hurricane on august 1 early on august 2 celia began to weaken and fell to category 2 intensity storm weakened further to a category 1 hurricane on august 3 however while approaching texas coastline later that day celia began to rapidly intensify again at 1800 utc on august 3 celia peaked with sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h and a minimum pressure of late on august 3 celia made landfall near corpus christi texas celia weakened while moving further inland and dissipated over new mexico on august 6 in cuba heavy rains on island caused severe flooding leading to five fatalities storm surge and swells lashed west coast of florida especially panhandle several life guard rescues occurred while eight people drowned in louisiana abnormally tides caused minor coastal flooding strongest sustained wind speeds in texas were around while winds gusts were estimated to have reached as high as in nueces county much of damage was caused by a series of microbursts and downbursts most of which occurred in a 15 minute span severe damage was reported in nueces county with 85 of celia s total property losses caused in corpus christi alone approximately 90 of downtown buildings were damaged or destroyed while about one third of homes in city suffered severe impact or were demolished throughout state 8 950 homes were destroyed and about 55 650 others were damaged about 252 small businesses 331 boats and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed in texas celia caused 15 deaths and 930 million in damage tropical storm eight a tropical depression developed about 95 mi 155 km east northeast of abaco islands in bahamas at 12 00 utc on august 15 initially depression moved west northwestward before turning northward early following day around 06 00 utc on august 16 system made landfall near beaufort north carolina with winds of 35 mph 55 km h after re emerging into atlantic early on august 18 depression moved northeastward and intensified into a tropical storm ship hotel observed sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h around that time at 18 00 utc storm peaked with winds of 70 mph 110 km h and a minimum pressure of shortly thereafter cyclone became extratropical about east of sable island along coast of north carolina higher than normal tides capsized about 20 boats including a yacht at salvo where tide may have reached above normal boardwalks and camping equipment were damaged at campgrounds heavy squalls produced winds as strong as 75 mph 120 km h in atlantic beach minor wind damage was reported in atlantic beach and morehead city primarily limited to some trees power lines roof shingles television antennas and signs from north carolina to maryland lifeguards made dozens of rescues four drowning deaths occurred with two in north carolina and two in virginia tropical storm dorothy a tropical wave moved off western coast of africa on august 13 moving westward a tropical disturbance spawned by wave led to formation of a tropical depression beginning east of lesser antilles on august 17 as it moved west northwestward it slowly intensified and was upgraded to tropical storm dorothy on august 19 by following day dorothy attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of around that time dorothy crossed island of martinique after passing through lesser antilles dorothy moved under an upper level cold core trough which caused storm to weaken on august 23 dorothy dissipated south of tiburon peninsula of haiti throughout lesser antilles dorothy produced high winds and heavy rainfall on martinique large amounts of precipitation resulted in flooding and mudslides which in turn caused bridge collapses and damage to homes in addition strong tropical storm force winds were also reported on island storm destroyed 186 homes and left 700 people homeless banana sugar cane and other crops sustained heavy losses flooding rains also dominica and guadeloupe but with less severe effects while exact death toll of dorothy is unknown some sources claim that as many as 51 fatalities occurred storm damage amounted to 34 million hurricane ella a well defined trough spawned a tropical depression near cabo gracias a dios honduras on september 8 depression moved northwestward without intensifying before striking tulum quintana roo on september 10 hours later system emerged into gulf of mexico and soon strengthened into tropical storm ella a ridge to north caused it to curve in a general westward direction just six hours after becoming a tropical storm ella intensified into a hurricane early on september 11 while approaching gulf coast of mexico cyclone deepened significantly peaking as a category 3 hurricane on september 12 with winds of 125 mph 205 km h and a minimum pressure of shortly thereafter ella made landfall near la pesca tamaulipas at same intensity hurricane rapidly weakened inland falling to tropical storm intensity on september 13 and dissipating several hours later in yucatan peninsula wind gusts of 55 mph 90 km h were observed ella brought heavy rainfall to portions of northeastern mexico several homes were destroyed and villages along san marcos river were inundated by water one girl died after her house collapsed flooding and continuous precipitation prevented transportation of relief items including food and medicine by helicopters in texas tides peaked at above normal but no coastal flooding damage was reported tropical storm felice on september 12 a tropical depression developed from an upper level trough just south of abaco islands without significant intensification system crossed florida keys and entered gulf of mexico felice remained a disorganized storm for its entire duration plagued by dry air a lack of deep thunderstorm activity and an ill defined center of circulation however early on september 16 cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph 110 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of felice tracked northwestward and brushed southern louisiana on september 15 before making landfall near galveston texas later that day once ashore felice quickly deteriorated as it recurved into central united states dissipating on september 17 while over southeastern oklahoma however its remnants still closely resembled a formidable tropical cyclone in advance of cyclone officials advised residents in vulnerable communities to evacuate their homes and temporary storm shelters were established however effects from felice were generally light beneficial rains fell over parts of southern florida while sections of coastal louisiana experienced minimal gale force winds and above normal tides in texas winds gusting to 55 mph 89 km h at galveston and estimated near 70 mph 110 km h elsewhere caused scattered power outages and minor tree damage while heavy rainfall totaling over 6 in 150 mm triggered some street flooding felice delayed local rice harvest and ruined some hay that had been cut before storm significant precipitation and gusty winds accompanied system into northern texas and oklahoma tropical depression fifteen a long lived depression formed on september 24 just off west coast of africa and for several days maintained a general westward track it passed through lesser antilles on october 1 and later stalled in eastern caribbean sea on october 8 depression crossed eastern portion of dominican republic and subsequently accelerated to northeast it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on october 12 although its remnants persisted for another week before dissipating in westerlies near azores depression produced heavy rainfall in lesser antilles reaching on barbados it left three deaths and moderate damage on island another death was reported in united states virgin islands torrential rainfall in puerto rico inflicted heavy damage with precipitation peaking at in jayuya of which fell in a 24 hour period far exceeding peak rainfall amounts during 1928 and 1899 hurricanes most of damage was inflicted to sugar cane and coffee crops additionally at least 600 houses were destroyed and another 1 000 sustained damage while about 10 000 people were left homeless storm affected at least 40 state roads including 15 blocked by landslides and 11 bridges destroyed overall damage in puerto rico totaled 65 million at least 18 people were killed on island and system was considered one of worst disasters in puerto rican history tropical storm greta a tropical wave exited western africa and emerged into atlantic ocean on september 15 it moved slowly westward until september 22 when a high pressure area caused it to accelerate west northwestward towards leeward islands by next day wave interacted with a cold core low producing an area of convection as system moved over warmer waters a surface low formed on september 26 as a result of gale force winds being observed system was then designated as tropical storm greta however storm did not strengthen despite favorable conditions and as a result it was described by national hurricane center nhc as a bomb that did not explode while approaching florida keys greta abruptly weakened to a tropical depression coinciding with deterioration of cloud pattern in addition hurricane hunters reported rising pressures and lower winds on evening of september 27 greta made landfall in key west florida with sustained winds of once in gulf of mexico greta did not re intensify though it retained a closed circulation while moving around a high pressure area it moved across northern yucatan peninsula though it quickly re emerged into gulf of mexico eventually greta made landfall near tampico mexico on october 5 and dissipated shortly thereafter due to weak nature of storm minimal impact was reported in florida tides were generally minor and were no more than above normal as reported in florida keys rainfall was mostly light though of precipitation was observed in fort pierce hurricane eighteen on october 12 a subtropical depression developed while located northeast of bahamas it steadily intensified and became a subtropical storm by following day after tracking east northeastward storm made a sharp westward turned followed by a curve to north northeast after fully acquiring tropical characteristics subtropical storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone early on october 16 twelve hours later storm strengthened into a hurricane shortly before passing near bermuda it continued to intensify and briefly became a category 2 hurricane on october 17 hurricane then accelerated rapidly northeastward and made landfall on avalon peninsula of newfoundland as a category 1 hurricane shortly thereafter hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on october 17 hurricane produced high winds on bermuda canceling classes interrupting transportation and closing businesses though damage was minimal in addition light rain fell on island throughout newfoundland hurricane force winds caused damage to structures mostly in form of broken windows rough seas along atlantic coast of island damaged fishing dories and a fishing ramp heavy rainfall was also reported in some areas of region reaching nearly 5 in 130 mm in quebec damage on burin peninsula was in thousands of canadian dollars although specific figure is unknown on french territory of saint pierre and miquelon several buildings lost their roof due to high winds hurricane nineteen a subtropical depression developed about east northeast of bermuda at 12 00 utc on october 20 after intensifying into a subtropical storm early following day further strengthening was slow initially system northeastward but curved southeastward on october 24 during that time it began acquiring characteristics of a tropical cyclone transitioning into a tropical storm at 12 00 utc storm resumed its northeastward motion and continued to intensify early on october 27 storm strengthened into a hurricane based on a report of winds of 75 mph 120 km h from pretoria several hours later at time of hurricane intensity it is likely that hurricane force wind field was only in radius and its tropical storm force wind field was only in diameter by 12 00 utc on october 27 cyclone weakened to a tropical storm and began accelerating about 24 hours later system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated approximately north northeast of graciosa in azores other systems in addition to ten named storms of 1970 and notable tropical depression fifteen there were several minor systems that were also classified as depressions by nhc a tropical depression developed offshore of north carolina on july 27 initially depression tracked toward outer banks but veered east southeastward and avoided landfall while nearing bermuda on july 30 depression slowly curved north northeastward by late on august 1 depression dissipated while located east of cape race newfoundland tropical depression five developed on august 2 in vicinity of cape verde it moved west northwestward across eastern north atlantic ocean and eventually curved nearly due eastward depression dissipated about halfway between puerto rico and west coast of africa on august 6 while tropical depression nine was dissipating in open atlantic on august 5 tropical depression ten developed near bahamas by following day depression made landfall near palm bay florida and dissipated early on august 7 on august 7 tropical storm seven developed over eastern atlantic it moved westward toward lesser antilles before dissipating northeast of islands on august 12 next depression originated about halfway between lesser antilles and cape verde on september 3 system moved west southwestward for much of its duration and dissipated by september 9 another tropical depression began just offshore dakar senegal on september 5 it crossed through cape verde before dissipating on september 7 later that month next system formed just east of cape verde on september 22 depression dissipated on september 25 after moving northwestward across far eastern atlantic on september 29 a system developed about southeast of bermuda depression moved rapidly north northeastward and dissipated about south of cape race newfoundland on october 1 storm names following names were used for named storms tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in north
