mower engine to a bicycle frame roberts began his career in dirt track racing after attending a local race in modesto and deciding that he wanted to compete himself his father purchased a bike for him but once it proved itself uncompetitive as a race bike he moved up to a more powerful motorcycle roberts showed a natural talent for dirt track racing and began winning local races in 1968 his race results drew attention of a local suzuki dealer bud aksland who offered to sponsor roberts aboard a suzuki motorcycle he made decision to drop out of high school before his senior year to pursue a

palace finishing in fourth place racing history a m a grand national championship realizing that roberts needed more help if his racing career was going to progress aksland introduced roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer jim doyle who would become roberts personal manager in 1971 doyle and roberts approached triumph s american distributor to ask about possibility of a sponsored ride but were told that roberts was too small for one of their bikes they then turned to american yamaha importer s team who agreed to make roberts a factory sponsored rider at age of 19 yamaha asked head of their american racing program former 250 cc world champion kel carruthers to help guide roberts racing career it marked beginning of a long and productive relationship between two men carruthers ended his riding career after 1973 season to concentrate full time on managing roberts and yamaha s efforts in a m a grand national championship a series which encompassed events in

just his second season as an expert roberts won national championship amassing a record 2 014 points in 25 race series while roberts had a natural talent for riding motorcycles on dirt surfaces on paved road circuits motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn during a race at ontario motor speedway he observed finnish rider jarno saarinen using a riding style where he shifted his body weight towards inside of a turn roberts tried technique and found that it helped settle motorcycle he adopted cornering style and exaggerated body shift to a greater extent than saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed track surface with his new riding technique roberts began to excel in road race events yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing where yamaha tz750 was dominant motorcycle of era in 1974 daytona 200 after early leader gary nixon retired roberts battled for lead with former 500 cc world champion giacomo agostini before an overheated engine forced him to settle for second place in april 1974 roberts ventured to europe for first time to compete in prestigious imola 200 road race for 750 cc motorcycles he made a positive impression competing against best road racers in world once again finishing second to agostini he then traveled to england with a team of american riders to compete against a british riding team in 1974 transatlantic match races conventional wisdom at time was that american riders who competed mostly in dirt track races could not race on asphalt at same level as british riders who specialized in road racing events roberts dispelled any such notions by winning three of six races and finishing second in remaining three races roberts was top individual points scorer in event with 93 points five more than barry sheene top british rider roberts returned to compete in 1974 grand national championship and won his first national road race at road atlanta on june 2 1974 on august 18 roberts won

before finishing third in 1974 250 cc dutch tt roberts continued his road racing successes in 1975 winning three out of four races in 1975 transatlantic match races after having won national championship in 1974 roberts faced an increasingly difficult battle in dirt track races as harley davidson continued to improve their xr 750 dirt tracker while yamaha struggled to maintain pace roberts made up for his bike s lack of power with an almost fearless determined riding style he battled harley davidson factory rider gary scott throughout 1975 season but mechanical breakdowns hampered his title defense he had been leading daytona 200 when mechanical problems yielded victory to his yamaha teammate gene romero at ascot tt roberts battled from 17th place to take lead before a broken sprocket ended his race roberts fearless riding style was highlighted at indy mile grand national in a desperate effort to keep scott within reach in points chase yamaha wedged a yamaha tz750 two stroke road racing engine inside a dirt track frame on a bike that was considered unrideable due to its excessive horsepower roberts came from behind on two stroke and overtook factory harley davidson duo of corky keener and jay springsteen on last lap for one of most famous wins in american dirt track racing history afterward roberts was famously quoted as saying they pay me enough to ride that thing despite accomplishing another grand slam this time in only one season roberts lost his crown finishing second to gary scott in 1975 national championship although roberts won four grand nationals in 1976 he continued to experience mechanical misfortunes as well as a horsepower deficit to harley davidson motorcycles in mile and half mile dirt track events he had been leading

harley davidson team he returned to england in april 1977 winning four out of six races at 1977 transatlantic match races roberts then travelled to italy where he raced in imola 200 leaving no doubt he was capable of competing at international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record he returned to united states to compete in grand national championship where he won five of six road races that made up pavement portion of series in road race event at sears point roberts started race at back of pack and passed entire field within four laps to win race despite being in contention for much of season roberts was unable to win any of dirt track events and eventually finished year in fourth place first american world champion when it became apparent that yamaha could not develop a dirt track motorcycle capable of competing with dominant harley davidson dirt track team american yamaha importer yamaha usa offered to send roberts to europe in 1978 to compete in world championship grand prix road racing series along with kel carruthers to act as his mentor and crew chief roberts also secured financial backing of goodyear tire company team planned to compete in 250 cc world championship as well as formula 750 series in order to have more practice time to learn tracks but their main focus would be on 500 cc class considered premier class at time his main competition in 500 cc world championship would come from suzuki rider barry sheene winner of two previous titles roberts said that he was initially indifferent about competing in europe but when he read that sheene had labeled him as no threat he made up his mind to compete few observers gave roberts any chance of winning championship citing reasoning that it would take him at least one season to learn european circuits thumb left upright roberts in 1978 motorcycle technology of late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what frames and tires of day could accommodate roberts riding style bred on dirt tracks of america revolutionized road racing prior to his arrival in europe riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners leaving braking until last possible moment then carving graceful arcs through corners with both wheels in line roberts did just opposite braking early then quickly applying throttle which resulted in rear tire breaking traction and spinning resulting tire spin caused motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction creating a brutal violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on racetracks of europe his riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding where sliding rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer motorcycle around a corner because of his early application of throttle he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors 1978 season started with roberts winning daytona 200 in a dominating fashion after several near misses forced him to retire while leading event roberts lapped entire field en route to his first daytona victory he then won a rain shortened imola 200 race and was second highest individual scorer behind pat hennen at 1978 transatlantic match races 1978 world championship chase did not start well for roberts at season opening round in venezuela thumb roberts 2 follows marco lucchinelli 11 during 1978 nations grand prix at mugello roberts would eventually go on to win race although roberts won 250 cc grand prix sheene claimed victory in 500 cc venezuelan grand prix while roberts yamaha suffered a mechanical failure on starting line in second round at spanish grand prix roberts was leading race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow american pat hennen roberts then won his first ever 500 cc grand prix with a win in austria quickly followed by two more victories in france and italy along with two second place finishes in netherlands and belgium at 1978 swedish grand prix roberts crashed during practice for 250 cc race sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury shaken up by accident he could do no better than seventh place in 500 cc race sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at venezuelan round but a string of podium finishes and a victory at swedish grand prix combined with roberts failure to score any points in finnish grand prix allowed him to close points gap thumb left kenny roberts 1 pursues johnny cecotto 4 and barry sheene 7 during 1978 500cc dutch tt race two championship contenders arrived in england for british grand prix with only three points separating them race ended in controversy when torrential rains during race along with pit stops for tire changes by both roberts and sheene created confusion among official scorers eventually roberts was declared winner with sheene being awarded third place behind privateer steve manship who did not stop for a tire change in final race of season at daunting long nurburgring racetrack in germany roberts finished in third place ahead of sheene in fourth place to claim first world championship for an american rider in grand prix road racing history he also scored four victories to finish second behind johnny cecotto in formula 750 world championship and won two races to finish fourth in 250 cc world championship rebel leader 1979 season began disastrously for roberts when he suffered career threatening back injuries and a ruptured spleen in a pre season crash while testing a motorcycle in japan his injuries caused him to miss season opening grand prix in venezuela but he completed an impressive recovery by winning second round in austria followed by a second place in germany and another victory in italy controversy again surrounded roberts at spanish grand prix when spanish race organisers knowing that roberts had to race to maintain his points lead refused to pay him starting money as guaranteed by fim regulations an angered roberts proceeded to win race and then refused to accept winner s trophy fim initially suspended championship points leader for his actions but suspension was later reduced to probation further controversy ensued at belgian grand prix at spa circuit circuit had been paved just days before race creating a track that many of racers felt was unsafe due to diesel fuel seeping to surface roberts and new championship points leader virginio ferrari instigated a riders revolt and refused to race once again fim responded by suspending roberts and ferrari fim later reduced this to another probation event highlighted animosity between roberts and fim concerning track safety roberts further irritated fim when he began talking to press about forming a rival racing series to compete against fim s monopoly series then moved on to britain where roberts would be involved in one of closest races in grand prix history roberts battle with sheene at 1979 british grand prix at silverstone has been cited as one of greatest races of 1970s minutes before start of race roberts yamaha blew a seal and sprayed bike with oil his crew managed to replace seal in time but roberts went to starting line with his gloves coated with oil causing his hand to slip on throttle during race race began with roberts sheene and dutch rider wil hartog breaking away from rest of field of riders hartog eventually fell behind as roberts and

finish in season ending french grand prix along with a crash by his main championship rival ferrari secured his second consecutive world championship in december 1979 roberts made good on his threats when he along with other top world championship riders released a letter to press announcing their intention to break away from fim and create a rival race series called world series when roberts first arrived on grand prix scene motorcycle racers were competing for as little prize money as 200 at venues such as imatra circuit in finland that featured railroad crossings and hay bales wrapped around telephone poles in 1956 reigning 500 cc world champion geoff duke and thirteen other riders were given six month suspensions for merely threatening to strike roberts adopted a confrontational sometimes belligerent stance with race promoters challenging previously accepted poor treatment that motorcycle racers of day were accustomed to receiving although competing series was not successful due to difficulties in securing enough venues it forced fim to take riders demands seriously and make changes regarding their safety during 1979 fim congress new rules were passed increasing prize money substantially and in subsequent years stricter safety regulations were imposed on race organizers a third world championship in february 1980 roberts made a remarkable return to american grand national championship for two races at season opening houston tt and short track events held in houston astrodome over two evenings after more than a year away from dirt track competitions roberts won

roberts and carruthers de facto factory racing team season got underway two months late due to cancellation of austrian and venezuelan rounds barry sheene had been replaced by randy mamola as top suzuki rider as sheene had been dissatisfied with suzuki s efforts and had turned to a privateer yamaha team roberts won first three races as suzuki team appeared to be in disarray but by third race of mamola and marco lucchinelli were making things more difficult for roberts roberts yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and a faulty rear shock absorber in dutch tt forcing him to pull out of race but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with cecotto ferrari and hartog all missing races due to injuries and sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns suzuki riders went on to win
