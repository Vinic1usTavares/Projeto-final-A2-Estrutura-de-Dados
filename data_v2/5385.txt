glial tube v blood vessels adapted from a paper by woong sun et al 2010 rostral migratory stream rms is a specialized migratory route found in brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in subventricular zone svz of brain migrate to reach main olfactory bulb ob importance of rms lies in its ability to refine and even change an animal s sensitivity to smells which explains its importance and larger size in rodent brain as compared to human brain as our olfactory sense is not as developed this pathway has been studied in rodent rabbit and both squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey when neurons reach ob they differentiate into gabaergic interneurons as they are integrated into either granule cell layer or periglomerular layer although it was originally believed that neurons could not regenerate in adult brain neurogenesis has been shown to occur in mammalian brains including those of primates however neurogenesis is limited to hippocampus and svz and rms is one mechanism neurons use to relocate from these areas brief history rms was named and discovered by j altman in 1969 using 3h in rat brain he traced migration of labeled cells from svz which is situated throughout lateral walls of lateral ventricles rostrally to main olfactory bulb he also quantitatively studied effect of age on size of rms there is still some ongoing debate about extent of rms and adult svz neurogenesis of new neurons in humans cell biology vascular cells vascular cells are known to play a prominent role in regulating proliferation of adult neural precursors in adult zone sgz dense clusters of dividing cells were found to be anatomically close to vasculature especially capillaries contacts between adult svz neuronal precursors and blood vessels are unusually permeable and frequently devoid of astrocyte and interferences suggesting that blood derived cues are gaining direct access to adult neural precursors and their progeny vasculature also provides substrate for new neuron migration after injury in adult striatum in rms vascular cells are arranged parallel to route of migrating cells and provide a scaffolding glial cells are also associated with blood vessels communication between these cells may be important for rms migration for example in bdnf brain derived neurotrophic factor a growth factor that is thought to module rms migration astrocytes astrocytes form gap junctions and are closely associated with vasculature and its basal lamina in adult svz and subsequently in rms they may serve as an interface to modulate influences of endothelial and circulation derived factors as well as availability of cytokines and growth factors in this system in addition astrocytes derived from neurogenic hippocampus and svz but not from non neurogenic spinal cord promote proliferation and neuronal fate commitment of adult neural stem cells in culture suggesting a role in rms astrocytes express a number of secreted and membrane attached factors both in vitro and in vivo that are known to regulate proliferation and fate specification of adult neural precursors as well as neuronal migration maturation and synapse formation in adult svz astrocytes express robo receptors and regulate rapid migration of expressing neuroblasts through rms additionally it has been proposed that neuroblasts themselves play a role in modulating astrocytes through slit robo interactions in absence of slit astrocytic processes do not align correctly or create tubes instead running across migrating neurons adult svz astrocytes also appear to release glutamate to regulate survival of neuroblasts unique to adult svz ependymal cells lining ventricular wall are in close association with neural precursors and their progeny acting like a shield to protect neurogenic niche a zone in which stem cells are retained after embryonic development for production of new cells of nervous system other glial cells ependymal cells actively regulate neuronal fate specification of adult neural precursors through release of noggin beating of cilia of ependymal cells appears to set up concentration gradients of guidance molecules such as cytokines tnf a tumor necrosis factor and igf 1 insulin like growth factor to direct migration of neuroblasts such as in rms microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis under basal conditions apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from niche by unactivated microglia in adult sgz under inflammatory conditions reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis depending on balance between secreted molecules with pro and anti inflammatory action in one study activation of microglia and recruitment of t cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment induced sgz neurogenesis suggesting a possible role in rms migration mechanics cells in rms are believed to move by chain migration these neuroblasts are connected by membrane specializations including gap junctions and junctions moving along each other towards olfactory bulb through glial tubes pathway and mechanisms behind this movement are a ventriculo olfactory neurogenic system vons a glial framework and a cell signalling system ventriculo olfactory neurogenic system vons olfactory system is made up in part of rms which stretches from subventricular zone in wall of lateral ventricle through basal forebrain to olfactory bulb ob vons is name given to this pathway and it consists of subventricular zone rms olfactory tract and olfactory bulb developing neurons leave subventricular zone and enter rms and travel caudally and ventrally along undersurface of caudate nucleus this is referred to as descending limb upon reaching ventral side of caudate nucleus neurons follow rostral limb and travel ventrally and rostrally entering anterior olfactory cortex aoc aoc gives rise to olfactory tract which ends in olfactory bulb glial framework thumb phenotypes of proliferating cells in rostral migratory stream and dentate gyrus phenotypes of proliferating cells in rms and dg double labeled immunofluorescence studies showed that in rms most cells were brdu nestin arrow a and revealed presence of gfap filaments arrow b surrounding brdu cells asterisk b in dg brdu nestin cells c were seen and a few brdu gfap cells could also be found arrow d e brdu red nestin gfap green adapted from a paper by maryam faiz et al 2005 developing neurons travel toward olfactory bulb along rms via glial tubes which mark division between differentiated nervous tissue and tissue with embryonic characteristics uniquely cells travel tangential to brain surface parallel to surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in rms researchers believe this is not case adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes they have been determined to be astrocytes based on typical expression of gfap glial acidic protein and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology furthermore these glial cells were found to be positive for expression a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells developing neurons are identified by their expression of cell surface molecule a psa embryonic form of neural cell adhesion molecule ncam called psa ncam as well as b a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts proving cells of rms are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into olfactory bulb with removal of ncam neuroblasts scatter proving importance of ncam in chain formation neurons form both clusters and chains along lumen of these glial tubes once developing neurons reach core of olfactory bulb they detach from rms which is initiated by reelin and tenascin and move radially toward this migration is dependent on tenascin r and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons these neurons have been studied in vivo via electrophysiology and confocal imaging cell signaling nature of molecular cues involved in correct targeting of migrating precursors remains a question secretion of a chemoattractant factor by ob appears as a possibility and act on migrating neurons by inducing changes in growth cone to direct them nevertheless tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on migration on other hand a septum derived secreted factor showed a repulsive effect on svz cells more recently it has been shown that secreted molecule slit shows such a repelling effect on svz derived precursors furthermore have been demonstrated to have a regulatory influence on precursor cell chain migration and regulation of their divisions psa ncam appears as another candidate mice lacking ncam show a dramatically size reduced ob and an accumulation of migrating precursors along rms it is possible that lack of ncam results in agitation of neuron glia interactions and modifications in these interactions might in turn be responsible for inhibition of migration in rms it has been demonstrated that a cross talk exists between neurons and glial cells and data in favor of an active role of psa ncam in this process has been presented lack of psa ncam on surface of migrating precursors might alter proliferative properties of this glial cell population a scenario that appears reminiscent of occurring in neurodegenerative diseases even before any signs of neuronal damage current research existence in humans presence of an analogous rms in humans has been difficult to identify possibly because olfactory bulb is significantly less developed in humans than in rodents and thus harder to study and much of previous scientific work has been called into question concerning rms in humans in developing fetal brain and in young postnatal infants chains of immature neurons typical of rms were observed however there was little evidence for existence of a migrating chain along svz or olfactory peduncle to bulb in adult human brain even though there was a distinct population of adult neuronal stem cells in svz these researchers studied subjects from 0 to 84 years of age by analyzing brain sections that had been removed during surgery or during autopsies they discovered that cells that expressed dcx and psa ncam are present in brain sections taken from infants but have disappeared by 18 months yet further studies indicated presence of a small population of migrating immature neurons which originate solely from svz these neuroblasts appear singly or in pairs without forming chains in contrast to elongated chains of neuroblasts observed in rodent rms this suggests that rms is drastically reduced beyond infancy and especially into adulthood but is not absent however a direct correlation between stem cell quiescence and age has not yet been defined due to a high level of variability between individuals thus an rms analogous structure in adult human brain remains highly controversial age related decline extent of age related rms decline in humans has been subject of significant debate decline of neurogenesis in and migration from hippocampus in humans has already been well documented furthermore age related declines in activities of svz stem cells which migrate to ob via rms are in place by middle age in rodents in elderly mice studies showed that population of actively dividing svz cells and rate of interneuron replacement in ob are both drastically reduced indicating an age related decline in neuronal proliferation and migration through rms this decline was shown to be due to neuronal stem cell quiescence in svz even by middle age and not destruction much like in hippocampus pharmaceuticals another topic in current rms research pertains to pharmaceuticals scientists are still trying to tackle difficult task of administering drugs into brain and getting them past selective blood brain barrier in a recent study researchers tested role of rms in intranasal delivery of drugs into cns in this study experimenters disrupted rms in mice which obstructed uptake of intranasally administered into cns fluorescent tracers were also used to track medicine throughout brain it was found that medicine spread to all regions of brain including olfactory bulb study concluded that rms was extremely prevalent and necessary in central nervous system in order to deliver drugs intranasally study also noted that this research on rms is not sufficient but instead needs to be expanded some of limits and capabilities of rms are still unknown as well as some of hazards of it if drugs are to be administered into cns through rms all of details of rms must be known in order to ensure safe delivery of drugs to brain a6b1 integrin a study was conducted testing a specific integrin alpha six beta one and role it plays in rms study researched principle that chemoattractive molecules may play an important role in migration in rms study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice by using antibodies to bind to a6b1 integrin subunits found on neuroblasts researchers observed that migration was disrupted furthermore they investigated mechanism through which a6b1 integrin functions and determined it was via chemoattractant laminin this was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to rms and observing that doing so drew neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration researchers concluded with idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease references external links chain migration in svz rms figure from an article see joseph altman s original research category developmental neuroscience
