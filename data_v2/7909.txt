and d vasu were in charge of art direction and editing respectively in an interview with anu hasan on talk show with anu director and cinematographer balu mahendra stated that moondram pirai was inspired by suicide of his wife actress shoba she was 17 years old at time of her death in 1980 according to s shiva kumar of hindu climax of film was a clear allusion to how shoba left mahendra without warning kamal haasan has stated that when mahendra narrated story of moondram pirai to him he listened to mahendra for about twenty minutes before accepting role of male lead cheenu role of bhagyalakshmi was initially offered to sripriya who could not accept role due to her prior commitments before sridevi was chosen for it poornam vishwanathan was cast as school headmaster while silk smitha who had done around 20 films by then and was considered only for performing item numbers was cast as headmaster s sexually excited wife filming moondram pirai was predominantly shot in ooty and ketti a small town situated close to former shooting also took place in bangalore mahendra did not find hiring a train expensive at that time as a result he hired a train for film s scene where haasan and sridevi depart for ketti and another train for film s climax which was shot at ketti railway station although it was raining on day climax was shot mahendra decided to continue shooting scene even though rain was not part of film s script it took nearly three days to film climax in post production phase smitha s voice was dubbed by anuradha mahendra supervised anuradha s dubbing session and taught her methods to emote dialogues for smitha in film while film was under production team was scoffed at for making a film about a youth falling in love with an amnesiac and that film would not be a box office success film uses intense violin music in both its opening and closing credits in april 2006 mahendra said that inclusion of song ponmeni uruguthey in film was absolutely unnecessary stating that sole reason for its inclusion was presence of smitha in song to help promote film final length of film was themes and influences moondram pirai depicts a young woman whose mental state regresses to that of a child following an accident sexuality and repression of desire are dominant motifs similar to balu mahendra s previous film moodu pani 1980 film also explores possibility of unresolved sexual tension between protagonists critic k jeshi compares moondram pirai to other films based on physical and mental disabilities like sethu 1999 pithamagan 2003 2004 chandramukhi 2005 anniyan 2005 and ghajini 2005 when asked about reason amnesia was chosen for a disability mahendra said disorder is used as a camouflage and as an excuse to portray relationships in film film critic baradwaj rangan finds sequence where haasan s character cheenu narrates story of blue jackal to sridevi s character bhagyalakshmi to be a distant echo of arc negotiated by cheenu he is after all a nobody like jackal who through a salubrious twist of fate becomes ruler of a woman s life until he is restored at end to nobody he was a fraudulent claimant to her emotions in his book dispatches from wall corner a journey through indian cinema rangan says that although haasan is inspired by marlon brando scene where haasan burns himself while cooking and vents his anger on sridevi is reminiscent of acting style of marcel marceau in another book of rangan conversations with mani ratnam he states that in scene where cheenu enters bhagyalakshmi s room in brothel 22 august 2014 tamil matinee sathya jyothi films scene from 13 30 to 22 16 there was fumbling and embarrassment whereas in another haasan film nayakan 1987 haasan s character velu nayakar behaves as if he has visited a brothel

tragic choices hari narayan of hindu compared moondram pirai to another haasan film 1991 in both narratives protagonist s image of an ideal dreamgirl animate his antics cheenu according to narayan looks like a melange of john keats tragedy and sigmund freud s psychoanalysis narayan explains idea of cheenu keeping with him not only as an act of sympathy and love but also with intention to preserve her like a portrait narayan also states that character robert s antonio banderas attraction to vera cruz elena anaya in pedro almodovar s spanish film skin i live in 2011 is similar to cheenu
