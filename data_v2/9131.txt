absurdity of real witch trials to that end characters take events of episode seriously which leads to much of humour writers influences included witchfinder general crucible monty python and hammer horror films while names of witch finders were a tribute to late actor warren clarke many critics responded positively to episode praising humour especially that deriving from use of archaic language

genuine witch trials some transcripts of which pemberton and shearsmith had read as part of writing process fixation of characters on teats and suckling for instance was something shearsmith had seen in authentic trials one writing challenge concerned need for new information to be revealed with each of trial s witnesses this is what shaped structure of script pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 2 10 for shearsmith given that trials were already absurd they cannot be parodied humour of episode for him comes precisely from fact that characters take events so seriously and do not see this absurdity pemberton said that pair aimed for authenticity and did not seek to produce a spoof of a period piece to that end he was complimentary of yves barr a costume designer with whom writers had worked for a number of years who did a fantastic job creating this period on a shoestring given that in his view people don t do this period shearsmith was excited to film something set in 17th century episode was only period piece in first two series but writers expressed willingness to do another pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 29 14 they felt that setting showed that they

and shearsmith episode commentary 6 06 sinead matthews starred as sarah nutter jim howick as thomas nutter paul kaye as richard two shoes and trevor cooper as george waterhouse shearsmith was particularly pleased to have howick appearing in episode as he had appeared in horrible histories he added for shearsmith a weight of royalty comic coupling of howick and matthews had characters who were originally mistakenly named gadge but this did not fit with characters relationship with titular elizabeth couple were renamed nutter a reference to alice nutter of real world pendle witch trials pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 6 27 in addition to credited actors crew had a crowd of extras for one day of filming around 12 extras were used budget constraints allowed this number for a day or five extras for two days this constraint led to a change in script seeing crowd removed from trial pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 5 19 although uncredited goody two shoes was played by an actress who had appeared in psychoville one of pemberton and shearsmith s previous productions as joanne dunderdale an understudy pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 10 22 writers

release pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 1 28 pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 19 59 plot in 17th century england magistrate sir andrew pike warner summons witch finders mr warren shearsmith and mr clarke pemberton to village of little happens seventy year old elizabeth gadge sheen has been accused of witchcraft and pike is excited that news has attracted attention of outsiders pike and warren already seem convinced of gadge s guilt but clarke remains sceptical elizabeth s case is brought to trial following morning with assistance of cobbler richard two shoes kaye elizabeth s daughter sarah matthews and son in law thomas nutter howick testify that they have witnessed elizabeth sucking from teat of a furry creature and speaking to a mouse believed to be a demon elizabeth claims that sarah and thomas have falsely accused her and want to be rid of her to make room in their house george waterhouse cooper testifies against elizabeth and accused is questioned when others in courtroom begin laughing at her responses warren declares that next person to laugh will be executed as a witch after an argument breaks out witch finders and pike decide that rest of trial should be conducted in private elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for devil s mark a remorseful sarah tries to profess her mother s innocence but warren does not believe her elizabeth says that she has been prostituting herself to two shoes who wears a fur coat two shoes denies this and trial is adjourned throughout proceedings warren is accusatory while clarke is more cautious pike meanwhile is fascinated both by lewd acts in which elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by witch finders torturous implements clarke privately tells warren that he thinks elizabeth is innocent and that he is not sure that pair are doing god s work warren threatens that clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further trial resumes elizabeth having been tortured overnight and elizabeth s mouse snowflake is released so that it might lead them to witch warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of elizabeth when snowflake approaches elizabeth pike declares her a witch and sentences her to be burned thomas and sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound elizabeth who awaits execution clarke dismisses them he removes hood from figure to reveal that he has

revival of trade and visitors to village warren is taken away to be burnt clarke releases real elizabeth but she reveals that she truly is a witch she breaks clarke s neck killing him there are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light elizabeth s face she tells snowflake that she will go to her master then transforms into a raven and leaves analysis trial of elizabeth gadge is a period piece tribute to witchfinder general blood on satan s claw and crucible while names warren and clarke are a homage to british actor warren clarke who at time of production and airing had recently died names were selected prior to clarke s death specifically because they were amusing but period appropriate and not because actor had any link to episode s themes but writers chose to keep them as a tribute upon death of clarke with whom shearsmith had previously worked pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 4 29 style and humour is reminiscent of horrible histories and monty python for instance one scene was directly inspired by laughing guard scene in monty python s life of brian pemberton and shearsmith themselves however did not consider episode to be particularly reminiscent of monty python pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 10 25 humour is childish but many of jokes are bawdy and adult though one critic said that episode was first straight up comedic episode of second series another said that episode s humour was balanced with tragedy and poignancy arguing that whole episode has an element of horror this was especially true given that story reflects actual happenings depiction of torture was described as genuinely upsetting despite sole setting of barn episode evokes a degree of folk horror trial of elizabeth gadge was described by jonathan wright guardian and phoebe jane boyd den of geek as like a hammer horror film with added humour and writers for irish examiner said that episode should appeal to both horror and comedy fans given that gadge is revealed to actually be a witch howick asked shearsmith whether former s character thomas truly had witnessed gadge engaging in some kind of supernatural activity shearsmith suggested that thomas was motivated by greed however he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses gadge being tortured pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 17 19 pemberton though noted that real life accusations of witchcraft must have been based on some level of belief reception thumb right critics commended performance of warner pictured 2013 as pike critics generally responded warmly to episode but some felt it compared poorly to others in series david chater writing for times felt that trial of elizabeth gadge was dissimilar from any previous episode of inside no 9 but that it was equally accomplished while in sister publication sunday times critics suggested that change in style showed writers versatility neela debnath writing for independent called trial of elizabeth gadge a hilariously dark little half hour of quintessentially british comedy rupert hawksley writing for daily telegraph was more critical he awarded trial of elizabeth gadge three out of five stars saying that despite a starry cast and a delightful twist and counter twist episode was nothing like as effective as la couchette and 12 days of christine previous two episodes of series episode he claimed was indicative of a mid series lull freelance journalist dan owen felt episode was entertaining fare but too predictable and cliched to prove genuinely memorable awarding it two out of four stars he too said episode felt like a mid series misstep shearsmith was unhappy with those who thought episode a dud or a misfire confessing that it was his favourite episode of second series pemberton felt it was going to be difficult to follow 12 days of christine but shearsmith was of view that episodes should not be in competition with each other pemberton and shearsmith episode commentary 12 30 episode s humour was praised by majority of commentators julia raeside writing for guardian said writers managed to pull together a loving tribute to their cult horror source material with an all out gag rate that most sitcoms would fail to keep up with claiming that they get look and tone just right and then inject it with kind of comedy that is perfectly tailored to puncture fictional world without deflating it similarly debnath felt that jokes including anachronistic references and dark were bang on by contrast hawksley claimed that episode had several inspired moments including a perfectly pitched joke about selfies but that writers had failed to properly exploit 17th century setting overall though finding it occasionally funny hawksley thought episode fell some way short of what we have come to expect from pemberton and shearsmith for comedy critic bruce dessau episode was all more hauntingly funny because it is played pretty straight but he noted that character of sir andrew pike allowed some offbeat humour chater called episode very very funny and philip cunnington of lancashire evening post called it one of funniest half hours of tv so far this year after conclusion of series television critics praised writing and acting of trial of elizabeth gadge though owen felt that ending held little surprise paddy shennan of liverpool echo said he loved fact that for third week running he couldn t work out twist for debnath best was saved till last but whole episode was tightly written patrick mulkern radio times too said that this dark tale soon works a devilish spell christine brandel writing for entertainment website popmatters particularly praised episode s beautifully done dialogue saying that it feels authentic in its phrasing even during more bizarre and hilarious court scenes owen similarly said dialogue was also frequently hilarious with shearsmith and pemberton having a fine ear for rhythms of olde english and how best to have characters deadpan their way through some ridiculous sentences hawksley praised warner s effortlessly batty performance as sir andrew pike and claimed that sheen brought an unsettling complexity to title character gerard gilbert of independent claimed warner was clearly having a ball as pike and wright guardian said warner quite brilliantly makes most of every line he s given brandel considered warner one of
