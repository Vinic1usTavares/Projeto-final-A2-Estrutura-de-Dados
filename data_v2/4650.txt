started when stock market in vienna austria crashed in june that year unsettling markets soon spread to berlin and throughout europe panic eventually reached new york when two banks went broke new york warehouse security company on september 18 and major railroad financier jay cooke company on september 19 ensuing depression lasted 5 years ruined thousands of businesses depressed daily wages by 25 from 1873 to 1876 and brought unemployment rate up to 14 causes of panic in united states included destruction of credit from over speculation in stock markets and railroad industry eight years of unprecedented growth after civil war had brought thousands of miles of railroad construction thousands of industrial factories and a strong stock market south experienced a boom in agriculture however all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in united states that have over speculated in railroad industry by as much as 20 million a strict monetary policy under secretary of treasury george s boutwell during height of railroad speculations contributed to unsettled markets boutwell created monetary by selling more gold then he bought bonds coinage act of 1873 made gold de facto currency metal over silver on september 20 1873 grant administration finally responded grant s secretary of treasury william adams richardson boutwell s replacement bought 2 5 million of five twenty bonds with gold on monday september 22 richardson bought 3 million of bonds with legal tender notes or greenbacks and purchased 5 5 million in legal tender certificates from september 24 to september

january 4 1874 richardson kept liquidating bonds until 26 million greenback reserves were issued to make up for lost revenue in treasury these actions did help curb effects of general panic by allowing more currency into commercial banks and hence allowing more money to be lent and spent historians have blamed grant administration for not responding to crisis promptly and for not taking adequate measures to reduce negative effects of general panic monetary policies of both secretary boutwell and richardson were inconsistent from 1872 to 1873 government s ultimate failure was in not reestablishing confidence in businesses that had been source of distrust panic of 1873 eventually ran its course despite all limited efforts from government democratic landslide in 1874 in off year congressional elections of 1874 democrats scored a major landslide a deep economic depression dispirited republicans and many other problems finally caught up with them it was an important turning

2000 religion and schools in a speech in 1875 to a veteran s meeting grant called for a constitutional amendment that would mandate free public schools and prohibit use of public money for sectarian schools he was echoing nativist sentiments that were strong in his republican party tyler anbinder says grant was not an obsessive nativist he expressed his resentment of immigrants and animus toward catholicism only rarely but these sentiments reveal themselves frequently enough in his writings and major actions as general in 1850s he joined a know nothing lodge and irrationally blamed immigrants

white house about evidence babcock gave grant an explanation that evidence did not concern ring and grant quietly accepted babcock s words at face value during prosecution of whiskey ring leaders grant testified on behalf of his friend babcock as a result babcock was acquitted however deposition by grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against president by grant s political opponents garland 1898 p 438 trading post ring in march 1876 it was discovered under house investigations that secretary of war william w belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an indian trading post agent to remain in position at fort sill belknap was allowed to resign by grant and as a result was acquitted in a senate impeachment

leland haworth hayes tilden disputed presidential election of 1876 1906 online historical evaluations grant s presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption an examination of his presidency reveals grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office in recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for african american civil rights grant had urged passing of 15th amendment and signed into law civil rights bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise he leaned heavily toward radical camp and often sided with their reconstruction policies signing into law force acts to prosecute ku klux klan in foreign policy grant won praise for treaty of washington settling alabama claims issue with britain through arbitration economically he sided with eastern bankers and signed public credit act that paid u s debts in gold specie but was blamed for severe

congress never allowed one item and fight em veto american heritage november 1995 his presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates nepotism practiced by grant was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment it was impossible for grant to morally check all of corruption generated from socioeconomic forces of a costly american civil war rapid industrialization and westward expansionism woodward 1957 his associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while president and afterward despite scandals by end of grant s second term corruption in departments of interior 1875 treasury 1874 and justice 1875 were cleaned up by his new cabinet members nevins 1957 p 833 grant s generous treatment of robert e lee at appomattox helped give him popularity in south although he kept civil rights on political agenda republican party at end of grant s second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies his weak response to panic of 1873 hurt economy and seriously damaged his party which lost heavily in 1874 grant s financial policies favored wall street but his term ended with nation mired in a deep economic depression that grant could not comprehend or deal with simon 1997 pp 258 259 revisionist historians during first half of twentieth century have tended to prop up a romantic view of confederacy and lost cause at expense of downgrading union cause and grant s presidency as a corrupt despot skidmore pp 150 151 20th century historical views of grant were less favorable political analyst michael barone noted in 1998 that ulysses s grant is universally ranked among greatest american generals and his memoirs are widely considered to belong with best military autobiographies ever written but he is inevitably named by conservatives as well as liberals as one of worst presidents in american history michael barone a better president than they think weekly standard august 3 1998 barone argues that this consensus however is being challenged by writers outside professional historians guild barone points to a lawyer frank scaturro who led movement to restore grant s tomb while only a college student and in 1998 wrote first book of modern era which portrays grant s presidency in a positive light barone said that scaturro s work was a convincing case that grant was a strong and in many important respects successful president it is an argument full of significance for how we see course of american political history scaturro s work should prompt a reassessment of entire progressive new deal tradition in 21st century grant s reputation and ranking had significantly increased that followed a series of positive biographies written by noted historians that included jean edward smith grant h w brands man who saved union ulysses grant in war and
