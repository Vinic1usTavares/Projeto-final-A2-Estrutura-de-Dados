antibodies is a naming scheme for assigning generic or nonproprietary names to monoclonal antibodies an antibody is a protein that is produced in b cells and used by immune system of humans and other vertebrate animals to identify a specific foreign object like a bacterium or a virus monoclonal antibodies are those that were produced in identical cells often artificially and so share same target object they have a wide range of applications including medical uses this naming scheme is used for both world health organization s international nonproprietary names inn and united states adopted names usan for pharmaceuticals in general word stems are used to identify classes of drugs in most cases placed word finally all monoclonal antibody names end with stem mab unlike most other pharmaceuticals monoclonal antibody nomenclature uses different preceding word parts morphemes depending on structure and function these are officially called substems and sometimes erroneously infixes even by usan council itself components thumb left structure ribbon diagram of an antibody four variable domains are outermost clusters shown top left and top right stem stem mab is used for monoclonal antibodies as well as for their fragments as long as at least one variable domain domain that contains target binding structure is included this is case for antigen binding fragments and single chain variable fragments among other artificial proteins other antibody parts such as fc regions and antibody use different naming schemes substem for origin source thumb source substems sketches of mouse top left chimeric top right humanized bottom left chimeric humanized bottom middle and human bottom right monoclonal antibodies human parts are shown in brown non human parts in blue variable domains are boxes on top of each antibody cdrs within these domains are represented as triple loops in april 2017 at who s 64th consultation on international nonproprietary names for pharmaceutical substances it was decided to drop source substem and from that meeting onwards it is no longer used in new antibody names substem preceding stem denoted animal from which antibody was obtained first monoclonal antibodies were produced in mice substem o yielding ending usually mus musculus house mouse or other non human organisms neither inn nor usan has ever been requested for antibodies from rats theoretically a hamsters e and primates i these non human antibodies are recognized as foreign by human immune system and may be rapidly cleared from body provoke an allergic reaction or both to avoid this parts of antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences or pure human antibodies can be engineered if constant region is replaced with human form antibody is termed chimeric and substem used was xi part of variable regions may also be substituted in which case it is called humanized and zu was used typically everything is replaced except complementarity determining regions cdrs three loops of amino acid sequences at outside of each variable region that bind to target structure although some other residues may have to remain non human in order to achieve good binding partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used xizu these three substems did not indicate foreign species used for production thus human mouse chimeric antibody ends in just as does human macaque antibody purely human antibodies used u rat mouse hybrid antibodies can be engineered with binding sites for two different antigens these drugs termed trifunctional antibodies had substem axo difficulty in capturing complexity and subtleties of many methods by which antibody drugs can be produced is one of reasons that inn dropped source substem substem for target substem preceding source of antibody refers to medicine s target examples of targets are tumors organ systems like circulatory system or infectious agents like bacteria or viruses term target does not imply what sort of action antibody exerts therapeutic prophylactic and diagnostic agents are not distinguished by this nomenclature in naming scheme as originally developed these substems mostly consist of a consonant a vowel then another consonant final letter may be dropped if resulting name would be difficult to pronounce otherwise examples include ci r for circulatory system li m for immune system lim stands for lymphocyte and ne r for nervous system final letter is usually omitted if following source substem begins with a consonant such as zu or xi but not all target substems are used in their shortened form mul for example is never reduced to mu because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting musculoskeletal system ever received an inn combination of target and source substems results in endings like limumab immune system human or ciximab circulatory system chimeric consonant r dropped new and shorter target substems were adopted in 2009 they mostly consist of a consonant plus a vowel which is omitted if source substem begins with a vowel for example human antibodies targeting immune system receive names ending in instead of old limumab some endings like ciximab remain unchanged old system employed seven different substems for tumor targets depending on type of tumor because many antibodies are investigated for several tumor types new convention only has t u prefix prefix carries no special meaning it should be unique for each medicine and contribute to a well sounding name this means that antibodies with same source and target substems are only distinguished by their prefix even antibodies targeting exactly same structure are differently prefixed such as adalimumab and both of which are tnf inhibitors but differ in their chemical structure additional words a second word following name of antibody indicates that another substance is attached which is done for several reasons an antibody can be pegylated attached to molecules of polyethylene glycol to slow down its degradation by enzymes and to decrease its immunogenicity this is shown by word pegol as in alacizumab pegol a cytotoxic agent can be linked to an anti tumor antibody for drug targeting purposes word vedotin for example stands for monomethyl e which is toxic by itself but predominantly affects cancer cells if used in conjugates like vedotin a chelator for binding a radioisotope can be attached pendetide a derivative of acid is used for example in capromab pendetide to chelate indium 111 if drug contains a radioisotope name of isotope precedes name of antibody consequently indium capromab pendetide is name for above example including indium 111 history thumb upright emil von behring one of discoverers of antibodies emil von behring and discovered in 1890 that diphtheria and tetanus toxins were neutralized in bloodstream of animals by substances they called antitoxins which were specific for respective toxin behring received first nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their find in 1901 a year after discovery paul ehrlich used term antibodies german for these antitoxins principle of monoclonal antibody production called technology was published in 1975 by georges kohler and cesar milstein who were awarded 1984 medicine nobel prize for their discovery together with niels kaj muromonab cd3 was first monoclonal antibody to be approved for clinical use in humans in 1986 world health organization who introduced system of international nonproprietary names in 1950 with first inn list being published three years later stem mab for monoclonal antibodies was proposed around 1990 and current system with target and source substems was developed between 1991 and 1993 due to collaboration between who and united states adopted names council antibody have same structure and are largely identical to inns until 2009 more than 170 monoclonal antibodies received names following this nomenclature in october 2008 who convoked a working group to revise nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies to meet challenges discussed in april same year this led to adoption of new target substems in november 2009 in spring 2010 first new antibody names were adopted examples new convention is an antineoplastic its name is composed of components t u mab this shows that drug is a human monoclonal antibody acting against tumors name of benralizumab a drug designed for treatment of asthma has components li zu mab marking it as a humanized antibody acting on immune system old convention adalimumab is a drug targeting tnf alpha its name can be broken down into ada lim u mab therefore drug is a human monoclonal antibody targeting immune system if adalimumab had been named after 2009 it would have been is a commonly used medication to prevent platelets from clumping together broken down into ab ci xi mab its name shows drug to be a chimeric monoclonal antibody used on cardiovascular system this and following two names would look same if new convention were applied name of breast cancer medication trastuzumab can be analyzed as tras tu zu mab therefore drug is a humanized monoclonal antibody used against a tumor alacizumab pegol is a pegylated humanized antibody targeting circulatory system technetium 99mtc and technetium 99mtc nofetumomab merpentan are antibodies merpentan being a chelator that links antibody nofetumomab to radioisotope technetium 99m on a nonproprietary name adopted by usan council american medical association is a polyclonal antibody broken down into lim u pab its name shows drug to be a human polyclonal antibody acting on immune system suffix pab shows it is a polyclonal antibody deviations monoclonal antibody muromonab cd3 approved for clinical use in 1986 was named before these conventions took effect and consequently its name does not follow them instead it is a contraction from murine monoclonal antibody targeting cd3 see also list of monoclonal antibodies monoclonal antibody therapy references
