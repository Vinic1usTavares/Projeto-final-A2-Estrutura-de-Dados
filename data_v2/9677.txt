financially shrewd ship owner and merchant but embargo act of 1807 which prohibited u s vessels from carrying goods to other countries and war of 1812 left his family in financial difficulties motts

thomas joseph k mansfield david hunter dennis hart mahan and albert sidney johnston top graduates of academy generally chose engineers as their branch but greene decided on artillery and was commissioned a second lieutenant in 3rd u s artillery regiment however due to his excellent academic performance he stayed at academy until 1827 as an assistant professor of mathematics and as a principal assistant professor of engineering one of students he taught during this period was cadet robert e lee palmer pp 28 29 in summer of 1828 greene married mary elizabeth vinton sister of his

in 1833 tragedy struck greene s family elizabeth and all three of their children died within seven months probably from tuberculosis to ease pain on his mind and to escape isolation and loneliness of peacetime army garrison duty he immersed himself in study of both law and medicine coming close to professional certification in both by time he resigned his commission in 1836 to become a civil engineer palmer pp 31 33 greene built railroads in six states and designed municipal sewage and water systems for washington d c detroit and several other cities in new york city he designed croton

children together including four sons three of them later served in military one daughter and one son who died in infancy palmer pp 34 47 civil war despite being over 60 years old and having been out of army for 25 years crisis of union compelled greene to seek to rejoin service he was essentially apolitical and was not an abolitionist but he was a firm believer in restoring union he was appointed colonel of 60th new york volunteer infantry on january 18 1862 eicher p 266 regiment of upstate new yorkers had been dissatisfied with their colonel and company commanders had petitioned for his removal governor edwin d morgan although initially reluctant to appoint greene because of his age saw his 13 years of regular army experience as a solution to his political military problem during this period governor john a andrew of massachusetts was also prepared to offer greene a regiment but greene chose to serve new york officers of 60th were dismayed when elderly gray haired man reported for duty they had requested that their lieutenant colonel be promoted which would have raised many of them in rank themselves palmer pp 54 55 on april 28 1862 greene was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and served on staff of maj gen nathaniel banks in shenandoah valley campaign against stonewall jackson at age 61 greene was one of oldest generals in union army and his troops took to calling him old man or pap greene there were actually 17 general officers in civil war older than greene however his age did not keep him from being one of most aggressive commanders in army he commanded 3rd brigade 2nd division ii corps of army of virginia at battle of cedar mountain during northern virginia campaign attacked by a confederate force three times size of his own greene and his men refused to give ground holding out until neighboring union units were forced to withdraw his division commander brig gen john w geary received a severe wound during action and greene took command of division temporarily greene was again temporarily elevated to command of his division now designated part of xii corps of army of potomac at battle of antietam his division s three brigades were led by junior officers who had survived cedar mountain greene s report from antietam even though xii corps commander brig gen joseph k mansfield was killed shortly after fighting began greene led a crushing attack against confederates near dunker church achieving farthest penetration of maj gen stonewall jackson s lines than any union unit under immense pressure greene held his small division only 1 727 men engaged at start of day palmer p 80 in advance of rest of army for four hours but eventually withdrew after suffering heavy losses while division was posted to harpers ferry greene took a three week sick leave maj gen oliver o howard speculated that greene like many of his fellow officers was sickened by stench of dead and wounded at antietam when he returned there was a new division commander brig gen geary greene was disgruntled that geary with only a few days seniority over him was selected for post geary had been wounded at cedar mountain and his combat record was not as good but his political connections and a sentiment that a wounded officer should not be set back in his career unnecessarily gave him nod palmer pp 99 100 greene resumed command of 3rd brigade which was involved in minor skirmishes in northern virginia and not engaged at battle of fredericksburg in december palmer pp 105 107 at battle of chancellorsville in may 1863 his brigade was in center of line when union right xi corps collapsed greene s brigade was subjected to enfilade artillery fire and then infantry assaults he had ordered his men to fortify their positions to their front using abatis and trenches and they were able to hold out against several confederate assaults although losing 528 men of 2 032 engaged during part of battle greene once again assumed temporary command of division when geary was wounded again gettysburg thumb 350px culp s hill defenses afternoon july 2 thumb 350px johnson s attack evening july 2 battle of gettysburg was highlight of greene s military career on july 2 1863 maj gen george g meade shifted almost entire xii corps from union right to strengthen left flank which was under heavy attack greene s lone brigade of 1 350 new yorkers five regiments was left to defend a one half mile line on culp s hill when an entire confederate division attacked kuhl pp 880 83 fortunately greene had previously demonstrated good sense as befits a civil engineer by insisting that his troops construct strong field fortifications despite a lack of interest in doing so from his division commander geary and corps commander maj gen henry w slocum in greene s finest moment of war his preparations proved decisive and his brigade held off multiple attacks for hours he was active entire engagement rallying his men to defend their positions in darkness brig gen alpheus williams acting corps commander on july 2 commended greene for his skill and judgment in this defense especially in his using advantages of his position williams s report from gettysburg late at night rest of xii corps returned to culp s hill fighting resumed next morning and raged for over seven hours but union troops held culp s hill they regained some of lost ground and thwarted renewed confederate attacks battle for culp s hill included two oldest generals in each army greene at 62 and brig gen william extra billy smith at 65 desperate fighting on union right flank was as important as more famous defense of union left flank on july 2 by col strong vincent s brigade on little round top in fact given that union line was only from vital union supply line on baltimore pike it can be argued that it was more important however greene s contribution to this critical battle have never been widely heralded principally because of a dispute between meade and slocum over filing of their official reports but a member of greene s brigade wrote murray p 55 western theater in fall of 1863 xii corps was transferred to west to reinforce union forces besieged at chattanooga at battle of wauhatchie during a surprise night attack by confederate forces greene was wounded in face with his jaw crushed and some teeth carried away subsequent surgery was not able to correct his condition and he suffered from effects of his wound for rest of his life after six weeks of medical leave he was assigned to light court martial duty until january 1865 when he was sent to join maj gen william t sherman s army in north carolina initially greene voluntarily served on staff of maj gen jacob d cox participating in battle at kinston where he had his horse shot out from under him palmer pp 234 35
