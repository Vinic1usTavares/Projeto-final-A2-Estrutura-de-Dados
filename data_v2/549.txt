immediately after announcement showed that only 22 percent of women were excited about ferraro s selection versus 18 percent who agreed that it was a bad idea by a three to one margin voters thought

time and that if she fully retired she would go nuts 2008 presidential election involvement in december 2006 ferraro announced her support for democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton later she vowed to help defend clinton from being in a manner akin to 2004 presidential candidate john kerry she assisted with fundraising by assuming an honorary post on finance committee for clinton s 2008 presidential campaign a heated nomination battle emerged between clinton and barack obama ferraro became livid and distraught when one of her daughters voted for obama in massachusetts primary saying what is matter with you you know hillary you have seen my involvement with her when her daughter responded by noting that obama was inspirational ferraro snapped what does he inspire you to do leave your husband and three kids and your practice and go work for doctors without borders this was seen as an example of a generational difference among american women in contrast to ferraro s generation younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president especially one with clinton s past history compared to what writer anne kornblut called milestone of electing an african american president according to kornblut younger voters saw clinton as both a relic of that era and a victim of its success she was wrong woman at wrong time she was a clinton she hadn t gotten there on her own kornblut notes from cracked ceiling pp 13 15 same account is given by author in campaign between two also saw racial dust ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates in march 2008 ferraro gave an interview with daily breeze in which she said if obama was a white man he would not be in this position and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and country is caught up in concept ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging jesse jackson s candidacy in party s presidential primaries saying that because of his radical views if jesse jackson were not black he wouldn t be in race ferraro justified statements by referring to her own run for vice president echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988 ferraro said that i was talking about historic candidacies and what i started off by saying was that if you go back to 1984 and look at my historic candidacy which i had just talked about all these things in 1984 if my name was gerard ferraro instead of geraldine ferraro i would have never been chosen as a vice presidential candidate it had nothing to do with my qualification her comments resonated with some older white women but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere kornblut notes from cracked ceiling p 73 there was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of obama and obama called them patently absurd clinton publicly expressed disagreement with ferraro s remarks while ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist again speaking to breeze ferraro responded to attacks by saying i really think they re attacking me because i m white how s that ferraro resigned from clinton s finance committee on 2008 two days after firestorm began saying that she didn t want obama camp to use her comments to hurt clinton s campaign ferraro continued to engage issue and criticize obama campaign via her position as a fox news channel contributor by early april ferraro said people were deluging her with negative comments and trying to get her removed from one of boards she was on this has been worst three weeks of my life ferraro stated in mid that clinton had raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level than when i ran she thought obama had behaved in a sexist manner and that she might not vote for him during september 2008 ferraro gained attention yet again after announcement of sarah palin as republican vice presidential nominee first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984 palin mentioned ferraro as well as clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance kornblut notes from cracked ceiling pp 90 91 in reaction to nomination ferraro said it s great to be first but i don t want to be only and so now it is wonderful to see a woman on a national ticket ferraro speculated that pick might win republican presidential nominee john mccain election but said that she was supporting obama now due to his running mate selection of joe biden having resolved her concerns about obama s lack of experience in certain areas ferraro criticized media s scrutiny of palin s background and family as gender based and saw parallels with how she was treated by media during her own run a university of alabama study also found that media framing of ferraro and palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles a newsweek cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from ferraro s time to palin s but ferraro correctly predicted that bounce that mccain received from palin pick would dissipate in a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with george h w bush ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than palin did now but that it was important that palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that little girls could see someone there who can stand toe to toe with biden mccain and palin ended up losing but regardless of 1984 or 2008 election result ferraro said that every time a woman runs women win final year death and tributes ferraro continued to battle cancer making repeated visits to hospitals during her last year and undergoing difficult procedures much of her care took place at dana farber cancer institute in boston where she also acted as an informal advocate for other patients she was able to make a joint appearance with palin on fox news channel s coverage of november 2010 midterm elections in she went to massachusetts general hospital to receive treatment for pain caused by a fracture a common complication of multiple myeloma once there however doctors discovered she had come down with pneumonia unable to return to her new york home ferraro died at massachusetts general on 2011 in addition to her husband and three children who were all present she was survived by eight grandchildren president obama said upon her death that geraldine will forever be remembered as a trailblazer who broke down barriers for women and americans of all backgrounds and walks of life and said that his own two daughters would grow up in a more equal country because of what ferraro had done mondale called her a remarkable woman and a dear human being she was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society she broke a lot of molds and it s a better country for what she did george h w bush said though we were one time political opponents i am happy to say gerry and i became friends in time a friendship marked by respect and affection i admired gerry in many ways not least of which was dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics palin paid tribute to her on facebook expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her year before and saying she broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more may her example of hard work and dedication to america continue to inspire all women bill and hillary clinton said in a statement that gerry ferraro was one of a kind tough brilliant and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in a new york icon and a true american original a funeral mass was held for her on march 31 at church of st vincent ferrer in new york site where ferraro and zaccaro had been married and had renewed their vows on their 50th anniversary year before figures from local state and national politics were present and mondale and both clintons were among speakers she is buried in st john cemetery in
