mississippi was lead ship of originally built by us navy in 1904 1908 class was built to a design smaller than other american battleships as result of a limit on displacement imposed by congress as part of an effort to constrain costs ships were armed with a main battery of four standard for pre dreadnought battleships of time but to secure that heavy primary armament significant compromises in speed secondary batteries and armor protection were necessary to keep ship within prescribed displacement limit mississippi served with atlantic fleet from 1909 to 1912 which consisted primarily of

were ordered under terms of 1903 naval appropriations which stipulated a maximum designed displacement of limit was an effort led by senior naval officers including admiral george dewey and captain alfred thayer mahan who believed a force of smaller but more numerous battleships would better suit navy s needs elements in congress also opposed continually increasing size and more importantly cost of each new battleship design limited displacement amounted to a reduction of compared to preceding which necessitated significant compromises in speed armament and armor making them poor designs unable to serve with main fleet and led to their quick disposal mississippi was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of she displaced 13 000 long tons as designed and up to at full combat load
