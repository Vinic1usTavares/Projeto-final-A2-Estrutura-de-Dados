1960 quartet consisted of backstroker mark kerry breaststroker peter evans butterflyer mark tonelli and freestyler neil brooks team was nominally led by its oldest member tonelli who was 23 and was also a spokesperson for australian athletes campaign for their right to compete at olympics against wishes of fraser government team was seen as an unlikely prospect to win all four of swimmers had clashed with swimming authorities over disciplinary issues and three experienced suspension or expulsion from australian team during their careers australia had previously won medals in event but was not regarded as one of favourites for gold as soviet union great britain and sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over component legs of relay after backstroke leg australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of soviet leaders however evans was fastest among breaststrokers and moved team into second position at halfway point in race and tonelli a makeshift butterflyer completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best allowing australia to keep soviet lead reasonable australia s anchor swimmer brooks overtook his more soviet counterpart sergey koplyakov in latter half of final leg to secure a narrow victory quartet disbanded after olympics due to tonelli s retirement although some of members continued to be present in relay team at various times alongside new swimmers by 1986 all four members of 1980 team had retired from international competition personnel australian team for event was a young and inexperienced foursome mark tonelli was oldest at age of 23 followed by mark kerry who turned 21 a month after olympics both were attending their second olympics while peter evans and neil brooks were 18 and 17 respectively and had never represented australia at commonwealth world championship or olympic level evans and brooks were from western australia a state that had never been prominent in australian swimming team members had some contact prior to their olympic selection brooks family had billeted tonelli in 1976 when australian olympic team held a training camp in perth brooks cited his experience with tonelli as a motivating factor in his career howell p 244 thumb australian prime minister malcolm fraser pictured pressured australian athletes to boycott olympics quartet was also marked by rebellious and anti establishment tendencies tonelli and kerry were expelled from 1978 commonwealth games team by australian swimming union for violating a curfew during a training camp in hawaii before team s trip to edmonton canada for competition forrest p 85 tonelli had been out drinking and admitted to smoking marijuana which was not illegal in hawaii while kerry had been courting a female tonelli pp 83 86 in 1980 during lead up to selection of olympic team brooks walked out of a training camp alleging that coaches were neglecting him while evans once stopped during a training session and refused to do extra mileage emphatically proclaiming that work is a poor substitute for talent later in their careers evans and brooks continued to have their clashes with swimming officialdom evans over his coaches demands for more training mileage and brooks over swimmers human rights brooks was later suspended twice in his career for his clashes with swimming authorities and expelled from australian institute of sport for indiscipline talbot heads and berry p 124 rebel qualities of group were on show in lead up to olympics an obstacle arose with 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan which resulted in a boycott of games by a large part of western world led by united states australian prime minister malcolm fraser was also patron of australian olympic committee and he and sections of public put significant political pressure on athletes to join boycott tonelli realised that only sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated he took a leadership role among athletes fighting for their right to compete and publicising their cause to australian community howell p 239 gordon p 334 evans was fully supportive of tonelli s campaign reflecting that we were political tools and only ones to suffer would be us howell p 241 he rhetorically asked do you really think that if we didn t go someone would come up to us after games and pat us on back for not going howell p 242 kerry was equally adamant that he was going to compete unlike some swimmers who decided to make personal boycotts he received offers from australian officials to not compete in return for financial payments he said according to women s swimming captain lisa forrest forrest p xiv tonelli adopted populist tactics in championing athletes cause he said that fraser was sending wheat to feed russian army wool to clothe army and australian metal to make russian guns claiming that this contradicted proposed protest against invasion and russian military aggression forrest p 43 tonelli s anti authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself during media appearances including a news interview in which he debated with reverend lance shilton who had called athletes traitors forrest pp 163 164 shilton expressed sympathy for athletes which tonelli interpreted as condescension he responded by rolling his eyes and twirling his finger a gaffe that was shown on national television tonelli mistakenly thought that only his voice was being broadcast at time and that images were showing something else forrest said that damage was done one of our most prominent anti boycott lobbyists looked like a smart alec event history and expectations united states had always won 4 x 100 m medley relay since event s inception at olympics in 1960 with comfortable margins closest winning buffer was 2 6 seconds and in 1972 and 1976 they had won by 4 10 and 3 72 s respectively their boycott opened up field in event in five previous times event had been contested australia s best result had come in inaugural race in rome where team of david theile terry gathercole neville hayes and geoff shipton out touched japan to claim silver only other time that australia had won a medal was in tokyo in 1964 when peter reynolds ian o brien kevin berry and david dickson finished behind united states and germany following two games saw a fourth placing and an elimination in heats previous outing in 1976 in montreal had seen australia come sixth kerry was only veteran of 1976 relay team who returned to olympics in moscow howell p 236 australia was regarded by swimming

events and their freestyle swimmer per would win silver in 100 m a few days later howell p 233 their weakest swimmer was breaststroker peter berggren who came ninth in 100 m on paper australia s team paled in comparison brooks later came seventh in his 100 m freestyle semifinal and 14th overall after having an asthma attack and evans was australia s only medallist in corresponding individual event winning bronze in breaststroke andrews p 148 kerry had been eliminated in 100 m backstroke semifinals while tonelli was australian champion in 100 m freestyle and backstroke but was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer nation did not have an entrant in 100 m butterfly adding to pressure was australia s failure to win any gold medals in any sport at 1976 olympics this meant that public were still awaiting their first gold since 1972 summer olympics in munich gordon p 333 coming into olympics australia was ranked seventh out of thirteen competing countries forrest p 212 race thumb right

place hosts led australians from start and extended their margin over each of first three legs brooks reclaimed 1 34 s on freestyle leg but australians fell 0 13 s short to come second in their heat nevertheless australians still qualified in second place overall as they and soviets were more than 1 5 s faster than third placed hungarians in any case despite resting all of their first choice quartet home team were still faster than australians who had fielded all but one of their full strength team evans took opportunity to attempt to regain psychological ascendancy from goodhew confronting him privately and stating that we will win it later reporting that briton was astounded by his posturing howell p 242 eldest swimmer in quartet at age of 23 tonelli convened team as its de facto leader he asked his compatriots to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time kerry vowed to swim backstroke in 57 s evans breaststroke in 63 s flat tonelli butterfly in 54 s and brooks promised to anchor team in 49 8 s even though he had never gone faster than 51 s tonelli named foursome quietly confident quartet because they exhibited a reserved self belief as they lined up for race whereas most of other teams were psyching up in marshalling area australians were remaining light hearted and placid confident that they could perform in water patching was one of several who had slipped on starting area earlier in meet so kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto soles of his feet soviet organisers had provided a carpet following incidents resulting in kerry leaving red footprints in stadium kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in individual event but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best he finished his leg in 57 87 s leaving australia in fourth place kuznetsov gave soviets lead after posting a time of 56 81 s with hungary and great britain in second and third place france was last to reach 100 m mark recording a time of 58 84 s

previous best over distance he began to lose ground in last 50 m and was a bodylength behind seredin until a late surge brought him to within a metre by time swimmers touched wall if tonelli had replicated his relay leg in individual event he would have claimed silver medal andrews pp 440 441 although he lost 0 36 s to seredin he had minimised his loss and australia were within 0 81 s going into final leg furthermore australians were now more than a second clear of third placed great britain brooks then executed a powerful well timed dive and surfaced almost even with his soviet counterpart kopliakov he had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn to take lead as they headed home soviet freestyler pulled level with 25 m to go before brooks again pulled away to seal an australian victory by 0 22 s he did not breathe in last ten metres and claimed to be laughing for final five metres confident that his opponent could not pass him howell p 245 brooks

regrets about fact that they ve gone fraser relented and late in night his office sent a telegram however he would not send his message directly to olympic village so telegram was sent to australian
