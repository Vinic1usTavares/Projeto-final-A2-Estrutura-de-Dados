promotion to general of division at battle of winterthur 1799 he had been one of ney s first brigade commanders although king s government may have expected conseil to find ney guilty members voted 5 2 to declare themselves incapable of reaching a verdict and deferred case to chamber of peers some historians maintain that ney s death penalty resulted from military court s refusal to act in case only military court could have returned a verdict of guilty under exceptional circumstances such a verdict would have meant ney s lifelong incarceration but would not have required his execution when military court refused to reach a verdict ney s case went to chamber of peers which was populated by a mix of old and new peers old peers might not have been receptive to ney s predicament he had been after all a highly visible party to napoleon s success throughout europe if some of new peers were sympathetic to ney s situation they may also have been anxious to prove their own loyalty to new regime ney s penalty was a foregone conclusion despite this or perhaps because of it louis xviii forced gazan into retirement in grasse where aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics after
