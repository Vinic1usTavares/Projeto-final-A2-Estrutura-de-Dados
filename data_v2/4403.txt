wish you were here is ninth studio album by english rock band pink floyd released on 12 september 1975 through harvest records and columbia records their first release for latter based on material pink floyd composed while performing in europe wish you were here was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at abbey road studios in london album s themes include criticism of music business alienation and a tribute to founding member syd barrett who left seven years earlier with deteriorating mental health like their previous record dark side of moon 1973 pink floyd used studio effects and synthesisers guest singers included roy harper who provided lead vocals on have a cigar and venetta fields who added backing vocals to shine on you crazy diamond to promote album band released double a side single have a cigar welcome to machine wish you were here received mixed reviews from critics upon its initial release who found its music to be uninspiring and inferior to their previous work it has retrospectively received critical acclaim hailed as one of greatest albums of all time and was cited by keyboardist richard wright and guitarist david gilmour as their favourite pink floyd album album reached number one in us and uk and harvest s parent company emi was unable to keep up with demand since then record has sold an estimated 13 million copies background during 1974 pink floyd sketched out three new compositions raving and drooling you gotta be crazy and shine on you crazy diamond these songs were performed during a series of concerts in france and england band s first tour since 1973 s dark side of moon as pink floyd had never employed a publicist and kept themselves distant from press their relationship with media began to sour mason said later that a critical nme review of band s new material written by syd barrett devotee nick kent may have had influence in keeping band together as they returned to studio in first week of 1975 concept wish you were here is floyd s second album with a conceptual theme written entirely by roger waters it reflects his feeling that camaraderie that had served band was by then largely absent album begins with a long instrumental preamble and segues into lyrics for shine on you crazy diamond a tribute to syd barrett whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave group seven years earlier barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as remember when you were young you shone like sun and you reached for secret too soon you cried for moon wish you were here is also a critique of music business shine on crosses seamlessly into welcome to machine a song that begins with an opening door described by waters as a symbol of musical discovery and progress betrayed by a music industry more interested in greed and success and ends with a party latter lack of contact and real feelings between people similarly have a cigar scorns record industry fat cats with lyrics repeating a stream of cliches heard by rising newcomers in industry and including question by way which one s pink asked of band on at least one occasion lyrics of next song wish you were here relate both to barrett s condition and to dichotomy of waters character with greed and ambition battling with compassion and idealism album closes with a reprise of shine on and further instrumental excursions i had some criticisms of dark side of moon noted david gilmour one or two of vehicles carrying ideas were not as strong as ideas that they carried i thought we should try and work harder on marrying idea and vehicle that carried it so that they both had an equal magic it s something i was personally pushing when we made wish you were here fielder hugh sinking pink classic rock 48 christmas 2002 p59 recording thumb right alt a

studios alan parsons emi staff engineer for pink floyd s previous studio album dark side of moon had declined band s offer to continue working with them group had worked with engineer brian humphries on more recorded at pye studios and again in 1974 when he replaced an inexperienced concert engineer humphries was therefore natural choice to work on band s new material although being a stranger to emi s abbey road set up he encountered some early difficulties on one occasion humphries inadvertently spoiled backing tracks for shine on a piece that waters and drummer nick mason had spent many hours perfecting with echo entire piece had to be re recorded sessions for wish you were here at abbey road s studio three lasted from january until july 1975 recording on four days each week from 2 30 pm until very late in evening group found it difficult at first to devise any new material especially as success of dark side of moon had left all four physically and emotionally drained keyboardist richard wright later described these sessions as falling within a difficult period and waters recalled them as torturous mason found process of multi track recording drawn out and tedious while gilmour was more interested in improving band s existing material gilmour was also becoming increasingly frustrated with mason whose failing marriage had brought on a general malaise and sense of apathy both of which interfered with his drumming humphries gave his point of view regarding these struggled sessions in a 2014 interview there were days when we didn t do anything i don t think they knew what they wanted to do we had a and an air rifle and we d play these word games sit around get drunk go home and return next day that s all we were doing until suddenly everything started falling into place after several weeks waters began to visualise another concept three new compositions from 1974 s tour were at least a starting point for a new album and shine on you crazy diamond seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for new work mostly an instrumental twenty minute plus piece similar to echoes opening four note guitar phrase reminded waters of lingering ghost of former band member syd barrett gilmour had composed phrase entirely by accident but was encouraged by waters positive response waters wanted to split shine on you crazy diamond and sandwich two new songs between its two halves gilmour disagreed but was outvoted three to one welcome to machine and have a cigar were barely veiled attacks on music business their lyrics working neatly with shine on to provide an apt summary of rise and fall of barrett because i wanted to get as close as possible to what i felt that sort of indefinable inevitable melancholy about disappearance of syd raving and drooling and you gotta be crazy had no place in new concept and were set aside until following album 1977 s animals syd barrett s visit on 5 june 1975 on eve of pink floyd s second us tour that year gilmour married his first wife ginger that day band were completing mix of shine on you crazy diamond when an overweight man with shaven head and eyebrows entered carrying a plastic bag waters did not recognise him gilmour presumed he was an emi staff member wright presumed he was a friend of waters but realised it was barrett mason also failed to recognise him and was horrified when gilmour identified him in mason s pink floyd memoir inside out he recalled barrett s conversation as desultory and not entirely sensible storm thorgerson reflected on barrett s presence two or three people cried he sat round and talked for a bit but he wasn t really there waters was reportedly reduced to tears by sight of his former bandmate when fellow visitor andrew king asked how barrett had gained so much weight barrett said he had a large refrigerator in his kitchen and had been eating lots of pork chops he mentioned that he was ready to help with recording but while listening to mix of shine on showed no signs of understanding its relevance to him barrett joined gilmour s wedding reception in emi canteen but left without saying goodbye it was last time band members saw barrett until his death in 2006 barrett s appearance may have influenced final version of shine on you crazy diamond a subtle refrain performed by wright from see emily play is audible towards end instrumentation as with dark side of moon band used synthesizers such as ems vcs 3 on welcome to machine but softened with gilmour s acoustic guitar and percussion from mason beginning of shine on contains remnants from a previous but incomplete studio recording by band known as household objects wine glasses had been filled with varying amounts of fluid and recordings were made of a wet finger circling edge of each glass these recordings were multi tracked into chords and used in opening of shine on jazz violinist stephane grappelli and classical violinist yehudi menuhin were performing in another studio in building and were invited to record a piece for new album menuhin watched as grappelli played on song wish you were here however band later decided his contribution was unsuitable and until 2011 it was believed that piece had been wiped it turns out his playing was included on album but so low in final mix that band presumed it would be insulting to credit him he was paid ps300 for his contribution equivalent to ps in dick parry again played saxophone on shine on you crazy diamond opening bars of wish you were here were recorded from gilmour s car radio with somebody turning dial classical music heard is finale of tchaikovsky s fourth symphony vocals recording sessions had twice been interrupted by us tours one in april and other in june 1975 and final sessions which occurred after band s performance at knebworth proved particularly troublesome for waters he struggled to record vocals for have a cigar requiring several takes to perform an acceptable version his problems stemmed in part from stresses placed upon his voice while recording lead vocals of shine on you crazy diamond gilmour was asked to sing in his place but declined and eventually colleague and friend roy harper was asked to stand in harper was recording his own album in another of abbey road s studios and gilmour had already performed some guitar licks for him waters later regretted decision believing he should have performed song blackberries recorded backing vocals for shine on you crazy diamond touring band played much of wish you were here on 5 july 1975 at knebworth music festival roy harper performing at same event on discovering that his stage costume was missing proceeded to destroy one of pink floyd s vans injuring himself in process this delayed normal setup procedure of band s sound system as a pair of world war ii supermarine spitfire had been booked to fly over crowd during their entrance band were not able to delay their set result was that a power supply problem pushed wright s keyboards completely out of tune damaging band s performance at one point he left stage but band were able to continue with a less sensitive keyboard a piano and a simpler light show following a brief intermission they returned to perform dark side of moon but critics displeased about being denied access backstage savaged performance packaging right thumb alt bordering an asphalt

thorgerson had accompanied band on their 1974 tour and had given serious thought to meaning of lyrics eventually deciding that songs were in general concerned with unfulfilled presence rather than barrett s illness this theme of absence was reflected in ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with band thorgerson had noted that roxy music s country life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve censoring cover image and he copied idea concealing artwork for wish you were here in a black coloured shrink wrap therefore making album art absent concept behind welcome to machine and have a cigar suggested use of a handshake an often empty gesture and george hardie designed a sticker containing album s logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake to be placed on opaque sleeve mechanical handshake logo would also appear on labels of vinyl album this time in a black and blue background album s cover images were photographed by aubrey po powell storm s partner at design studio hipgnosis and inspired by idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings for fear of getting burned and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands one man on fire getting burned was also a common phrase in music industry used often by artists denied royalty payments two stuntmen were used ronnie rondell and danny rogers one dressed in a fire retardant suit covered by a

shot in yuma desert in california again by aubrey po powell absence of wrists and ankles signifies his presence as an empty suit inner sleeve shows a veil concealing a nude woman in a windswept norfolk grove and a splash less diver at mono lake titled german translation of mono lake on liner notes in california again emphasising theme of absence decision to shroud cover in black plastic was not popular with band s us record company columbia records who insisted that it be changed they were over ruled emi were less concerned band were reportedly extremely happy with end product and when presented with a pre production mockup they accepted it with a spontaneous round of applause release album was released on 12 september 1975 in uk and on following day in us it was pink floyd s first album with columbia records an affiliate of cbs band and their manager steve o rourke had been dissatisfied with efforts of emi s us label capitol records band remained with emi s harvest records in

in spain album remained at number one for 20 weeks critical reception on release album received mixed reviews ben edmunds wrote in rolling stone that band s lackadaisical demeanor leaves subject of barrett unrealised they give such a matter of fact reading of goddamn thing that they might as well be singing about roger waters s brother in law getting a parking ticket edmunds concluded band is devoid of sincere passion for their art that contemporary space rock acts purportedly have melody maker reviewer wrote from whichever direction one approaches wish you were here it still sounds unconvincing in its ponderous sincerity and displays a critical lack of imagination in all departments a positive review came from robert christgau in village voice music is not only simple and attractive with synthesizer used mostly for texture and guitar breaks for comment but it actually achieves some of symphonic dignity and cross referencing that dark side of moon simulated so ponderously years later he reflected further on record my favorite pink floyd album has always been wish you were here and you know why it has soul that s why it s roger waters s lament for syd not my
