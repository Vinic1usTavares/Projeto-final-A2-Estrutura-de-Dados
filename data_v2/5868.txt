mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics album received an average score of 62 based on seven reviews barry walters of spin wrote this stunning dane s synths plus strings slant on singer songwriter lovesickness offers refinement over innovation yet nanna oland fabricius with a gently insistent presence kerri mason of billboard opined that oh land might have made year s first great left field pop album praising songs as endlessly catchy and concluding that tilting scales of light and dark give collection a definite creep factor and a clever complexity allmusic s andrew leahey described album as an anything goes mix of multiple genres adding that oh land doesn t rewrite rule book as much as join ranks of la roux little boots and janelle monae but that doesn t keep her debut album from churning out a number of intelligent club anthems in a mixed review slant magazines sal cinquemani expressed that oh land s cinematic arrangements bring janelle monae s ambitious approach to pop music to mind but tracks like wolf i and lean draw a bit too heavily from trip hop playbook and however well they may be end up sounding derivative similarly fraser mcalpine of bbc music felt that there s a bit of an identity void at heart of thing a lack of personality it might just be that oh land is more skilled at getting songs to sound current than she is at expressing herself drowned in sounds john calvert called album hip diverse and always vibrant but also branded it pretty forgettable calvert pointed out production work of dave mccracken and dan carey noting album inhabits a tepid middle ground between two extremes offering neither gilded scandi chart pop robyn annie or artistic mettle of scandi indie bands most of whom are able to turn out sublime pop anyway commercial performance oh land debuted on danish albums chart at number 32 on 18 march 2011 it peaked at number five following week and spent a total of four weeks within top ten it reappeared
