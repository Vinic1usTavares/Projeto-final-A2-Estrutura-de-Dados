upright thumb gillian anderson s pregnancy altered storyline for season pictured anderson pregnant with her third child felix in 2008 season premiere was originally supposed to have been written by series creator chris carter in his initial pitch mulder would have been sent to moscow in fact producers wanted to film episode in russia but they were not able to secure appropriate arrangements in end carter was unable to complete script idea which would have also featured reopening of x files instead co executive producers glen morgan james wong and howard gordon penned opening premiere little green men episode was first entry to actually show an alien in series hurwitz and knowles p 55 this delay gave carter time to write duane barry start of series first two parter as series ended its first season a problem had arisen for producers pregnancy of gillian anderson who played dana scully some network executives wanted role recast which carter refused to do though they considered having scully giving birth to an alien child producers decided to work around anderson s pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later lowry p 24 this was described by executive producer frank spotnitz as best thing that ever happened to series as it helped form intricate mythology that would run throughout show hurwitz and knowles p 44 writers decided to close x files at end of first season and thus separate mulder and scully in earlier episodes of season to hide anderson s pregnancy in early episodes producers disguised it with very fancy trick angles trench coats and scenes where she is seated rather than standing two parter of carter s duane barry and paul brown s ascension were scripted to culminate in scully s abduction and re opening of x files anderson does not feature at all in following episode 3 as she was giving birth to her daughter at time of filming lowry p 176 casting season introduced character x played by steven williams who replaced deep throat as mulder s informant following deep throat s assassination in first season finale erlenmeyer flask x was originally intended to be a woman with natalija nogulich already cast in role but was replaced by williams as writers did not believe she had right chemistry with her co stars x was written to be different than deep throat deep throat had been selfless while x was intended to be selfish and scared lovece pp 28 29 nicholas lea who had previously appeared in a small part in season one s gender bender was cast as alex krycek krycek was originally intended as a temporary replacement for scully when she was abducted but grew into a character who would last seven seasons on show hurwitz and knowles p 57 during production of season duchovny asked carter wouldn t it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter carter was positive towards idea and acted upon it creating with character of alien bounty hunter for two part episodes colony and end game actor brian thompson auditioned for role in a casting session where he was competing with another actor spotnitz and carter did not have much time to cast character but they knew this casting would be important since they intended character to become a recurring character thompson was chosen according to spotnitz because he had a very distinctive look about him most notably his face and mouth megan leitch also appeared in colony and end game as a grown up clone version of samantha mulder and would return to play samantha or one of her clones over other seasons carter did not want it to be real samantha since that would have been straight science fiction and it was too ridiculous to give too many answers darren mcgavin star of kolchak night stalker was sought out for part of senator matheson in little green men and mulder s father in colony and end game but roles went to raymond j barry and peter donat respectively while mcgavin agreed to play x files founder arthur dales in season five
